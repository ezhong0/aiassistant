**Changes Made**:
- âœ… Optimized connection pooling with configurable min/max connections
- âœ… Added connection health monitoring and statistics
- âœ… Implemented automatic reconnection handling
- âœ… Added performance monitoring with slow query detection
- âœ… Enhanced error handling and logging
- âœ… Added connection pool event handlers for monitoring
- âœ… Implemented proper resource cleanup

**Impact**: Improves database performance, prevents connection leaks, and provides better visibility into database health.

## ðŸ“Š Impact Summary

### **Architecture Improvements**
