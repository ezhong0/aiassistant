## Implementation Notes

**Core vs Nice-to-Have Distinction:**

- **Core**: Solves an immediate, common pain point that users face daily
- **Nice-to-Have**: Adds convenience, handles edge cases, or provides deeper insights

**Critical Success Factors:**

1. **Speed**: Core queries must return in <3 seconds
2. **Accuracy**: 95%+ precision on core queries
3. **Natural Language**: Commands should feel conversational
4. **Context Awareness**: Remember what user just looked at
5. **Error Recovery**: Handle ambiguity gracefully with clarifying questions
6. **Cross-Account**: Core queries must work across all connected accounts

**What Makes This Different from Your List:**

1. More aggressive on what's "possible" - most features ARE buildable
2. Includes truly complex queries users actually need
3. Better progression from simple to advanced
4. Clearer implementation priority
5. More emphasis on behavioral/pattern detection
6. Stronger cross-platform integration queries
