# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records for the AI Assistant Application. ADRs document important architectural decisions, the context behind them, and their consequences.

## What are ADRs?

Architecture Decision Records are documents that capture important architectural decisions along with their context and consequences. They help teams understand why certain decisions were made and provide a historical record of the evolution of the system.

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows this structure:

1. **Title** - Clear, descriptive title
2. **Status** - Proposed, Accepted, Rejected, Deprecated, Superseded
3. **Context** - The issue motivating this decision
4. **Decision** - The change that we're proposing or have agreed to implement
5. **Consequences** - What becomes easier or more difficult to do and any risks introduced by this change

## ADR Numbering

ADRs are numbered sequentially and chronologically. Each ADR gets a unique number.

## Template

Use the template in `0000-template.md` when creating new ADRs.

## Current ADRs

- [0000-template.md](./0000-template.md) - ADR Template
- [0001-service-architecture.md](./0001-service-architecture.md) - Service Layer Architecture
- [0002-encryption-service.md](./0002-encryption-service.md) - Encryption Service Extraction
- [0003-sentry-integration.md](./0003-sentry-integration.md) - Sentry Error Tracking Integration

## Creating New ADRs

1. Copy the template: `cp 0000-template.md 000X-title.md`
2. Fill in the details
3. Update this README with the new ADR
4. Submit a pull request for review

## ADR Lifecycle

1. **Proposed** - Initial draft, under discussion
2. **Accepted** - Decision has been made and approved
3. **Rejected** - Decision has been rejected
4. **Deprecated** - Decision is no longer relevant
5. **Superseded** - Decision has been replaced by another ADR

## Best Practices

- Keep ADRs focused on a single decision
- Include enough context for future readers
- Be clear about the consequences
- Update status as decisions evolve
- Link related ADRs when appropriate
