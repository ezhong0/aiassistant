# ADR-0001: Service Layer Architecture

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2024-01-15  
**Deciders:** Development Team

## Context

The AI Assistant Application needs a robust, scalable architecture to handle multiple domain services (Email, Calendar, Contacts, Slack) with proper separation of concerns, dependency management, and error handling. The application must support complex workflows involving multiple external APIs while maintaining reliability and testability.

## Decision

We will implement a service-oriented architecture with the following components:

1. **BaseService** - Abstract base class providing common functionality (logging, health checks, lifecycle management)
2. **ServiceManager** - Centralized service registry and dependency injection container
3. **Domain Services** - Specialized services for each domain (Email, Calendar, Contacts, Slack)
4. **Infrastructure Services** - Core services (Database, Cache, Encryption, Error Tracking)
5. **Agent Layer** - AI agents that orchestrate domain services
6. **Middleware Layer** - Cross-cutting concerns (authentication, rate limiting, error handling)

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Separation of Concerns**: Each service has a single responsibility
- **Dependency Injection**: Services can be easily mocked and tested
- **Lifecycle Management**: Centralized initialization and shutdown
- **Health Monitoring**: Built-in health checks for all services
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error handling across services
- **Scalability**: Services can be independently scaled and optimized
- **Testability**: Services can be unit tested in isolation

### Negative

- **Complexity**: More moving parts and abstractions
- **Learning Curve**: Developers need to understand the service architecture
- **Initialization Order**: Careful management of service dependencies required
- **Memory Overhead**: Each service has its own lifecycle and state

### Neutral

- **Performance**: Slight overhead from service abstraction layer
- **Code Organization**: More files and directories to manage

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Monolithic Architecture**: Single large service handling all functionality
   - Rejected due to poor testability and maintainability

2. **Microservices Architecture**: Separate services running in different processes
   - Rejected due to complexity and overhead for current scale

3. **Functional Programming Approach**: Pure functions with minimal state
   - Rejected due to complexity of managing external API integrations

## Implementation Notes

- Services implement the `IService` interface for consistency
- ServiceManager handles dependency resolution and initialization order
- All services extend `BaseService` for common functionality
- Health checks are implemented at the service level
- Error handling follows a consistent pattern across all services
