# ADR-0003: Sentry Error Tracking Integration

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2024-01-15  
**Deciders:** Development Team

## Context

The application currently relies on Winston logging for error tracking and monitoring. While Winston provides excellent logging capabilities, it lacks:

1. **Error Aggregation**: No centralized error collection and analysis
2. **Performance Monitoring**: No built-in performance tracking
3. **Real-time Alerts**: No automatic alerting for critical errors
4. **Error Context**: Limited context about user actions and system state
5. **Release Tracking**: No correlation between errors and code releases
6. **User Impact Analysis**: No visibility into how errors affect users

## Decision

We will integrate Sentry for comprehensive error tracking and performance monitoring:

1. **Error Tracking**: Capture and aggregate application errors
2. **Performance Monitoring**: Track request performance and bottlenecks
3. **User Context**: Associate errors with specific users and sessions
4. **Release Tracking**: Correlate errors with code deployments
5. **Filtering**: Filter out non-critical errors (rate limiting, validation)
6. **Service Integration**: Integrate with the service architecture

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Comprehensive Error Tracking**: Centralized error collection and analysis
- **Performance Insights**: Identify performance bottlenecks and slow requests
- **User Impact Visibility**: Understand how errors affect specific users
- **Release Correlation**: Track error rates across code deployments
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Immediate visibility into application health
- **Error Filtering**: Reduce noise by filtering non-critical errors
- **Service Integration**: Consistent with the service architecture

### Negative

- **Additional Dependency**: New external service dependency
- **Data Privacy**: Error data sent to external service
- **Cost**: Sentry service costs for high-volume applications
- **Configuration Complexity**: Additional environment variables and setup

### Neutral

- **Performance Overhead**: Minimal overhead from error tracking
- **Storage**: Error data stored externally

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Enhanced Winston Logging**: Improve existing logging with better aggregation
   - Rejected due to lack of real-time monitoring and user context

2. **Custom Error Tracking**: Build internal error tracking system
   - Rejected due to development effort and maintenance overhead

3. **Multiple Tools**: Use different tools for different monitoring aspects
   - Rejected due to complexity and integration challenges

4. **No Error Tracking**: Continue with basic logging only
   - Rejected due to poor visibility into application health

## Implementation Notes

- `SentryService` extends `BaseService` and integrates with the service architecture
- Middleware captures HTTP requests and responses for context
- Error filtering excludes rate limiting and validation errors
- User context is automatically associated with errors
- Performance monitoring tracks request duration and bottlenecks
- Service is optional - application works without Sentry DSN
