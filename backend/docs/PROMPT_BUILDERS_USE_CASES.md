## Understanding Reasonable vs Unreasonable Requests

### ✅ **REASONABLE Requests** (AI with Google Workspace APIs Only)

**Core Capabilities (All via APIs):**
- **Email Operations**: Search, draft, send, organize emails using Gmail API
- **Calendar Management**: Schedule meetings, check availability, manage events using Calendar API
- **Contact Management**: Look up, organize, and manage contacts using Contacts API
- **Bulk Operations**: Send mass emails and schedule multiple meetings via API calls
- **Template Application**: Use user-provided email templates and apply them to recipient lists
- **Data Analysis**: Analyze available data from emails, calendar, and contacts to provide insights
- **Data Synthesis**: Combine information from multiple sources to create comprehensive reports
- **Complex Workflows**: Multi-step processes that can be accomplished through API sequences

**What Makes Requests Reasonable:**
- **API-Feasible**: Can be accomplished using only Gmail API, Calendar API, and Contacts API
- **Data Available**: Required information exists within Google Workspace data
- **No External Dependencies**: Doesn't require access to external systems or services
- **User-Provided Context**: Can work with templates, CSV data, and context provided by user

**Examples of Reasonable Requests:**
- "Send this welcome email template to all 50 new customers from this CSV list"
- "Schedule 1:1s with all engineering team members using this contact list"
- "Analyze my meeting patterns from last month and suggest optimizations"
- "Draft a follow-up email to the client about their proposal"
- "Create a summary of all investor communications from this quarter"
- "Process 1000 customer feedback emails and categorize them by sentiment and topic"
- "Coordinate a 50-person event with multiple sessions, speakers, and logistics"
- "Analyze 6 months of email data to identify communication patterns and inefficiencies"

### ❌ **UNREASONABLE Requests** (Cannot be accomplished with Google Workspace APIs only)

**External System Dependencies:**
- E-signature systems (DocuSign, HelloSign) - requires external API access
- IT system access (user provisioning, system administration) - requires external systems
- CRM systems (Salesforce, HubSpot) - requires external API access
- Project management systems (Asana, Jira) - requires external API access
- Analytics platforms (usage tracking, performance metrics) - requires external data sources
- Room booking systems (conference room reservations) - requires external booking systems
- Travel booking systems (flights, hotels) - requires external travel APIs
- External news sources (industry news, competitor monitoring) - requires external data feeds

**Data Not Available in Google Workspace:**
- Usage analytics and performance metrics from external applications
- Purchase history and customer behavior data from e-commerce systems
- Social media data and engagement metrics
- Website analytics and traffic data
- Financial data from accounting systems
- HR data from ATS and payroll systems

**System Creation Requirements:**
- Building databases, dashboards, or automated workflows
- Creating persistent storage systems
- Setting up automated triggers and rules
- Real-time monitoring and alerting systems

**Examples of Unreasonable Requests:**
- "Create a system to automatically track all customer interactions" (requires external CRM)
- "Set up automated follow-ups for all pending proposals" (requires automation system)
- "Integrate with our CRM to update customer records" (requires external CRM API)
- "Book conference rooms automatically for all meetings" (requires room booking system)
- "Monitor industry news and send daily summaries" (requires external news APIs)
- "Track customer usage analytics and send reports" (requires external analytics data)
- "Process invoices and update accounting system" (requires external accounting API)
- "Monitor social media mentions and respond" (requires social media APIs)

### **Key Principles:**

1. **Google Workspace APIs Only**: Limited to Gmail API, Calendar API, and Contacts API functionality
2. **API-Feasible Operations**: Can accomplish any task that can be done through API calls to these services
3. **Data Within Google Workspace**: Can only work with data available in Gmail, Calendar, and Contacts
4. **No External Dependencies**: Cannot access external systems, databases, or APIs
5. **User-Provided Context**: Can work with templates, CSV data, and context provided by user
6. **No System Building**: Cannot create databases, dashboards, or automated systems
7. **No Persistent Storage**: Cannot store data outside of Google Workspace services
8. **No Real-Time Monitoring**: Cannot set up automated triggers or real-time alerts

### **Making Requests Reasonable:**

**Instead of:** "Create a system to track customer satisfaction"
**Use:** "Analyze all customer feedback emails from last month and create a summary report"

**Instead of:** "Set up automated follow-ups for all prospects"
**Use:** "Send follow-up emails to these 25 prospects using this template and contact list"

**Instead of:** "Integrate with our CRM to update records"
**Use:** "Draft update emails for these customer records using this data from our CRM export"

**Instead of:** "Automatically monitor all communications"
**Use:** "Review all emails from the past week and identify key themes and action items"

**Instead of:** "Build a dashboard for meeting analytics"
**Use:** "Analyze my calendar data from the past 3 months and provide insights on meeting patterns"

### **What's Possible with Google Workspace APIs Only:**

**Email Operations (Gmail API):**
- Search, read, compose, send, and organize emails
- Process thousands of emails to identify patterns, sentiment, and key topics
- Send personalized emails to thousands of recipients with custom content
- Manage email threads, labels, and organization

**Calendar Operations (Calendar API):**
- Create, update, and manage calendar events
- Check availability and find optimal meeting times
- Schedule hundreds of meetings with complex availability coordination
- Analyze months of calendar data to optimize scheduling and identify inefficiencies

**Contact Management (Contacts API):**
- Read, create, update, and organize contacts
- Synthesize information from hundreds of contacts to create relationship insights
- Manage contact groups and organization

**Data Analysis & Synthesis:**
- Combine data from emails, calendar, and contacts to provide comprehensive business insights
- Identify trends and patterns across all communications to inform strategic decisions
- Create detailed reports and summaries from large volumes of information
- Process and categorize large volumes of incoming communications

**Complex Workflows:**
- Coordinate large events with dozens of participants, multiple sessions, and complex logistics
- Manage investor relations with regular updates, meeting coordination, and documentation
- Handle customer onboarding with personalized sequences and progress tracking

This approach ensures the AI executive assistant can be highly effective within the constraints of Google Workspace APIs while maintaining realistic expectations about what requires external systems or additional capabilities.
