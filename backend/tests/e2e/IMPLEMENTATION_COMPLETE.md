## 🏗️ What Was Built

### 1. Core Generator Components

#### ✅ `thread-templates.ts` (465 lines)
**Purpose:** Pre-defined realistic multi-email thread patterns

**What it contains:**
- `investorDroppedBall`: 4-email escalation chain (investor → managing partner CC)
- `customerProductionIssue`: Production crisis escalating to CEO
- `overdueCommitment`: User promises board metrics, misses deadline
- `teamQuestionBlocking`: Engineering lead blocked waiting for decision
- `normalHiringCoordination`: Regular back-and-forth (baseline)

**Key features:**
- Rich ground truth labels per email
- Temporal metadata (sentDaysAgo)
- Deadline specifications
- Urgency evolution rules
- Thread relationship tracking

**Example snippet:**
```typescript
export const investorDroppedBall: ThreadTemplate = {
  topic: 'Series B fundraising',
  threadType: 'escalating',
  isDroppedBall: true,
  hasEscalation: true,
  emails: [
    {
      id: 'inv-1',
      subject: 'Series B - Next Steps',
      sentDaysAgo: 14,
      labels: {
        senderType: 'investor',
        requiresResponse: true,
        isImportant: true,
      }
    },
    // ... 3 more escalating emails
  ]
};
```

#### ✅ `relationship-graph.ts` (566 lines)
**Purpose:** Models sender hierarchies and relationship dynamics

**What it contains:**
- Sender presets for 10 persona types (boss, customer, peer, investor, etc.)
- Relationship metadata (importance 1-10, email frequency, response time)
- Persona-specific relationship graphs (founder, executive, manager, individual)
- Helper functions for sender analysis

**Key features:**
- **Hierarchical importance:** Boss (9) > Customer (7-9) > Peer (5) > Spam (1)
- **Email frequency tracking:** Daily, weekly, monthly, rare, first-time
- **Behavioral patterns:** `likelyToFollowUp`, `escalatesQuickly`, `sendsAfterHours`
- **VIP designation:** Critical contacts flagged
- **Response time expectations:** Boss expects 2hr, customer 4hr, peer 48hr

**Example snippet:**
```typescript
const SENDER_PRESETS = {
  directBoss: {
    type: 'boss',
    importance: 9,
    emailFrequency: 'daily',
    typicalResponseTime: 2, // expects response within 2 hours
    isVIP: true,
    likelyToFollowUp: true,
    followUpCadence: 1, // follows up after 1 day
    escalatesQuickly: true,
  },
  // ... 9 more presets
};
```

#### ✅ `temporal-engine.ts` (528 lines)
**Purpose:** Time-aware email generation and urgency calculation

**What it contains:**
- Temporal context calculation (age, deadlines, overdue status)
- Urgency evolution rules (always urgent, became urgent, deadline approaching)
- Time-based utilities (daysAgo, endOfWeek, isBusinessHours)
- Thread timeline generation (normal, escalating, urgent patterns)
- Time-decay priority calculation

**Key features:**
- **Urgency types:** `always`, `became_urgent`, `deadline_approaching`, `never`
- **Deadline tracking:** Absolute vs relative, with time-until calculation
- **Business hours detection:** 9am-6pm, weekday/weekend awareness
- **Thread pacing:** Normal (1-2 days), escalating (gaps shorten), urgent (hours apart)

**Example snippet:**
```typescript
export function calculateTemporalContext(
  sentDate: Date,
  currentDate: Date,
  deadline?: DeadlineSpec,
  urgencyRule?: UrgencyEvolutionRule
): TemporalContext {
  // Calculate age
  const ageInDays = (currentDate.getTime() - sentDate.getTime()) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24);

  // Check if overdue
  const isOverdue = deadline ? currentDate > deadline.date : false;

  // Determine urgency evolution
  if (urgencyRule.type === 'became_urgent' && ageInDays >= rule.days) {
    urgencyType = 'became_urgent';
    isUrgentNow = true;
  }
  // ... more logic
}
```

#### ✅ `language-patterns.ts` (509 lines)
**Purpose:** Realistic email language templates

**What it contains:**

- Follow-up language by tone (polite, firm, frustrated, escalating)
- Question templates (direct, open-ended, yes/no, status)
- Urgency markers (subject line + body language)
- Sentiment-specific language (neutral, positive, frustrated, urgent, angry)
- Sender-specific style (formal vs casual, greetings/closings)

**Key features:**
- **Detectable patterns:** "I'll send X by Y", "2nd reminder", "per my last email"
- **Tone variation:** Polite → Firm → Frustrated → Escalating
- **Context generation:** Realistic full email composition
- **Email scenarios:** Pre-built templates for common situations

**Example snippet:**
```typescript
export const FOLLOWUP_LANGUAGE: Record<FollowUpTone, string[]> = {
  polite: [
    "Just following up on my email from {date}",
    "Checking in on this",
  ],
  frustrated: [
    "Per my last email, I still need this information",
    "Haven't heard back from you on this",
    "This is the {iteration} time I'm asking about this",
  ],
  escalating: [
    "Escalating this - I need a response immediately",
    "This is now blocking our team",
    "CC'ing {manager} as this is time-sensitive",
  ],
};
```

#### ✅ `hyper-realistic-inbox.ts` (655 lines)
**Purpose:** Main orchestrator generating complete realistic inboxes

**What it contains:**

4. **Generate noise emails** (spam, newsletters, deceptive subjects)
5. **Apply temporal context** to all emails
6. **Generate comprehensive ground truth** with 20+ labels per email
7. **Calculate statistics** (urgent count, dropped balls, overdue commitments)

**Example snippet:**
```typescript
export async function generateHyperRealisticInbox(
  options: InboxGenerationOptions
): Promise<GeneratedInbox> {
  // Phase 1: Build relationship graph
  const relationshipGraph = buildRelationshipGraph('user@company.com', persona);

  // Phase 2: Instantiate thread templates
  for (const scenario of scenarios) {
    const threadEmails = instantiateThreadTemplate(scenario.template, threadId);
    emails.push(...threadEmails);
  }

  // Phase 3: Generate normal emails
  // Phase 4: Generate noise emails

  // Return complete inbox with ground truth
  return { emails, groundTruth, relationshipGraph, persona, currentDate };
}
```

## 🚀 How to Use

### Generate a realistic inbox:

```typescript
import { generateHyperRealisticInbox } from './generators/hyper-realistic-inbox';

const inbox = await generateHyperRealisticInbox({
  persona: 'founder', // or 'executive', 'manager', 'individual'
  emailCount: 50,
  includeDroppedBalls: true,
  includeOverdueCommitments: true,
  includeEscalations: true,
  includeUrgentIssues: true,
});

console.log(`Generated ${inbox.emails.length} emails`);
console.log(`Dropped balls: ${inbox.groundTruth.stats.droppedBallCount}`);
console.log(`Overdue commitments: ${inbox.groundTruth.stats.overdueCommitmentCount}`);
console.log(`VIP senders: ${inbox.groundTruth.stats.vipCount}`);
```

### Run test suites:

```bash
# Run all e2e tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run specific suite
npm run test:e2e -- 01-inbox-triage.test.ts

# Run in watch mode
npm run test:e2e -- --watch
```

### Access ground truth:

```typescript
// Get email label
const label = inbox.groundTruth.emailLabels.get('email-1');

console.log(`Sender: ${label.senderName} (${label.senderType})`);
console.log(`Importance: ${label.senderImportance}/10`);
console.log(`Age: ${label.ageInDays} days`);
console.log(`Urgent: ${label.isUrgent}`);
console.log(`Dropped ball: ${label.isDroppedBall}`);
console.log(`Overdue: ${label.isOverdue}`);

  console.log(`Tone: ${label.followUpTone}`);
  console.log(`Keywords: ${label.followUpKeywords.join(', ')}`);
}
```

## 🎓 Key Innovations

### 1. **Temporal Awareness**
Unlike simple inbox generators that create static snapshots, this system models how emails age and evolve:
- Email sent 2 weeks ago with deadline today → became urgent over time
- Commitment made 5 days ago, deadline 2 days ago → now overdue
- Follow-up sent after 3 days of silence → escalation pattern detected

### 2. **Relationship Intelligence**
Not all senders are equal. The system models realistic hierarchies:
- Boss email unanswered for 1 day → HIGH PRIORITY
- Peer email unanswered for 1 day → normal priority
- Customer email unanswered for 1 day → HIGH PRIORITY (revenue risk)
- Investor email with 3 follow-ups → CRITICAL (escalated to managing partner)

### 3. **Thread Complexity**
Real threads have narratives that span days/weeks:
- Day 1: Initial request
- Day 4: Polite follow-up
- Day 8: Firm reminder
- Day 14: Escalation with CC to management

### 4. **Language Pattern Detection**
The system can detect nuanced patterns:
- Commitment detection: "I'll send the proposal by Friday"
- Follow-up detection: "Per my last email..." (passive-aggressive)
- Urgency detection: "This is blocking the team" (dependency urgency)
- Question detection: "Can you approve this?" (requires decision)

### 5. **Multi-Dimensional Priority**
Priority isn't just urgent/not urgent. It's calculated from:
- Temporal factors (age, deadline, overdue)
- Relationship factors (sender importance, VIP status)
- Content factors (questions, decisions, action items)
- Thread factors (dropped ball, escalation, blocks others)

- Sales escalation (customer unhappy with product)
- Hiring coordination (candidate interview scheduling)
- Project status thread (team updates)
- Budget approval thread (finance back-and-forth)
- Vendor negotiation thread (pricing discussion)
- Board reporting thread (metrics requests)
- Bug report thread (customer support)

### 5. Performance Optimization (1-2 hours)

Current: Generates 50 emails in ~200ms (acceptable)
Target: Maintain < 500ms for 100 emails

## 💡 Key Takeaways

**What makes this system "hyper-realistic"?**

1. **Temporal evolution:** Emails don't exist in isolation—they age, deadlines approach, commitments become overdue
2. **Relationship dynamics:** Not all senders are equal—hierarchies matter
3. **Thread narratives:** Real threads tell stories over days/weeks—initial ask → follow-up → escalation
4. **Language authenticity:** Detectable patterns like "I'll send X by Y" and "per my last email"
5. **Multi-dimensional priority:** Priority emerges from time + relationships + content + thread dynamics

**What problems does this solve?**

1. **Test coverage:** Can now test 50+ complex email commands systematically
2. **Edge case detection:** Realistic noise, deceptive subjects, passive-aggressive language
3. **Temporal logic:** Deadline tracking, overdue detection, time-decay urgency
4. **Relationship intelligence:** VIP prioritization, sender type filtering, importance hierarchies
5. **Commitment tracking:** Promise detection, fulfillment tracking, overdue commitments

**What's the path to production?**

1. Complete remaining 3 test suites (23 commands) → 50+ commands tested
2. Run full test suite against latest chatbot implementation
3. Fix any failing tests (precision/recall issues)
4. Performance tuning (< 3 seconds for all queries)
5. Deploy with confidence that core email commands work correctly
