## Email Body (Full Content)

Hi John,

I hope this email finds you well. I'm reaching out regarding the Q4 budget proposal that was submitted last week. We need your approval by end of day Friday (October 6th) to ensure we can move forward with the planned initiatives for the quarter.

The proposed budget includes several critical investments that align with our strategic priorities for the year. Specifically, we're allocating $2.3M for infrastructure upgrades, $1.8M for the new product development team, and $950K for marketing campaigns supporting our Q4 product launch. These numbers have been carefully reviewed by the finance team and reflect a 15% reduction from our initial projections based on the recent market conditions.

I've attached a detailed breakdown of all line items, along with ROI projections for each major category. The engineering team has flagged the infrastructure upgrades as particularly time-sensitive - they need to start procurement by October 10th to meet our delivery timelines for the new datacenter capacity. Any delay beyond that date will push the entire project into Q1, which would impact our ability to support the anticipated customer growth from the product launch.

Could you please review the attached documents and provide your approval? If you have any concerns or need clarification on any of the budget items, I'm available for a quick call this afternoon or tomorrow morning. We can also schedule a more detailed review meeting if needed, though given the tight timeline, I'd recommend we try to resolve any questions via email or a brief call first.

Thank you for your attention to this urgent matter. I know Q4 is always a busy time, but getting this approved quickly will really help us stay on track with our strategic objectives.

Best regards,
Sarah Chen
Chief Financial Officer
TechCorp Inc.
