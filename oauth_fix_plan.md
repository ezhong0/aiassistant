# OAuth Token Persistence Fix Plan

## Root Cause Identified ✅

The OAuth tokens are not persisting because:

1. **Database Connection Failure**: The DatabaseService is trying to connect to `postgres.railway.internal` which is not reachable from the local development environment
2. **Fallback to Memory Storage**: When database fails, the SessionService falls back to in-memory token storage
3. **Memory Storage is Volatile**: In-memory storage is lost on server restart/redeploy
4. **Session ID Mismatch**: There may be inconsistencies in how session IDs are generated and used

## Solutions

### Immediate Fix 1: Database Connection Configuration

The app is configured for Railway production but running locally. We need to:

1. Either set up a local PostgreSQL database
2. Or configure the app to use Railway's database URL for development
3. Or implement a hybrid approach with local SQLite for development

### Immediate Fix 2: Improve Token Persistence Fallback

Even when database is unavailable, we can:

1. Add file-based persistence as a backup
2. Improve error handling and retry logic
3. Add better logging for troubleshooting

### Immediate Fix 3: Session ID Consistency

Ensure all parts of the system use the same session ID generation strategy.

## Recommended Implementation

1. **Configure database connection properly** (choose between local DB or Railway connection)
2. **Add file-based token storage as backup** when database is unavailable
3. **Improve error handling and user feedback** when OAuth tokens are lost
4. **Add better debugging and monitoring** for token persistence issues

## Impact

These fixes will resolve:
- ✅ OAuth tokens persisting across server restarts
- ✅ Gmail authentication staying active after redeployment
- ✅ Better user experience with consistent authentication
- ✅ Better debugging capabilities for OAuth issues
