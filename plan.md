# üéØ AI Assistant Platform: DM-Only Bot Transition Plan

## üìã **Strategic Overview**

This plan implements a **DM-only Slack bot** with **draft-based confirmations** and a dedicated **Slack Agent** for message reading and context management. The design prioritizes privacy, user experience, and architectural consistency.

## üöÄ **Phase 1: DM-Only Transition**

### **Prompt 1.1: Slack Scope Migration**

**Architecture Context:** Based on our existing Slack integration in `backend/src/interfaces/slack.interface.ts` and `backend/src/services/slack-interface.service.ts`, we need to transition from channel-based to DM-only permissions while maintaining all existing functionality.

**Goal:** Update Slack app configuration and OAuth flow to support DM-only access while preserving current bot capabilities.

**Constraints:**
- Maintain existing SlackInterface and SlackInterfaceService patterns
- Preserve all current event handling logic
- Update OAuth scopes to DM-only permissions
- Ensure backward compatibility during transition
- Follow our established error handling patterns

**Integration Points:**
- Slack app configuration in Slack Developer Console
- OAuth flow in `backend/src/routes/slack.routes.ts`
- Event handling in `backend/src/interfaces/slack.interface.ts`
- Service initialization in `backend/src/services/service-initialization.ts`

**Testing Requirements:**
- OAuth flow tests for DM-only permissions
- Event handling tests for DM vs channel events
- Integration tests for DM functionality
- Error handling tests for permission failures

**Format:** Provide:
1. Updated Slack app configuration with DM-only scopes
2. Modified OAuth flow for DM permissions
3. Updated event handling logic for DM-only mode
4. Migration strategy for existing channel-based users
5. Comprehensive test updates

**Example:** Follow the existing OAuth pattern in `backend/src/routes/slack.routes.ts` but restrict scopes to `['im:history', 'im:write', 'users:read']` and update event filtering logic.

## ü§ñ **Phase 2: Slack Agent Implementation**

### **Prompt 1.2: Slack Agent Creation**

**Architecture Context:** Following our multi-agent architecture in `docs/AGENTS.md`, we need to create a specialized SlackAgent that handles Slack-specific operations including message reading, draft management, and confirmation handling. This agent should integrate with our existing AgentFactory pattern.
