# Cursor-Style AI Agent Architecture Plan

## Overview
Transform agents into intelligent AI-driven assistants that use tools (existing services) to understand, plan, and execute complex multi-step operations. Agents will work like Cursor or Claude Code - understanding natural language, deciding which tools to use, and orchestrating multi-step workflows.

## Strategic Principles
- **AI-First Design**: Agents use AI planning as primary execution path
- **Tool-Based Architecture**: Your existing services become "tools" for AI agents
- **Clean & Elegant**: No backwards compatibility complexity since we're still building
- **Performance Optimized**: Caching and parallel execution for speed
- **Service Reuse**: Leverage existing BaseAgent framework and service registry
