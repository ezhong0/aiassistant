## 1. üîß **SINGLE RESPONSIBILITY PRINCIPLE REFACTORING** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Impact: CRITICAL - Biggest architectural improvement opportunity**

### Current Issues (VERIFIED - September 2025):
- **5 major SRP violations** with files over 1,000 lines (confirmed by line count analysis)
- **SlackInterfaceService** (1,444 lines) - Event handling + OAuth + confirmation + proposal parsing + tool creation + message formatting + policy enforcement + context extraction
- **EmailAgent** (1,738 lines) - Email operations + contact resolution + validation + formatting + AI planning + error handling
- **CalendarAgent** (1,636 lines) - Event management + availability checking + formatting + AI planning + error handling + tool execution
- **SlackAgent** (1,336 lines) - Message reading + thread management + context extraction + AI planning + error handling
- **MasterAgent** (1,008 lines) - AI planning + OpenAI integration + schema management + context gathering + tool validation + proposal generation + memory monitoring + error handling
- **Additional issue**: **SlackInterface** (2,358 lines) - Massive interface file with potential bloat

### Why This Matters:
- **Hard to test** individual features in isolation
- **Changes break unrelated functionality** 
- **Code reviews become overwhelming** (1,000+ line files)
- **New developers struggle** to understand large files
- **Debugging is difficult** with mixed concerns
- **Maintenance becomes expensive** over time

### Proposed Solution:
Break down large classes into focused, single-responsibility components:

```typescript
// PRIORITY 1: SlackInterface Refactoring (2,358 lines ‚Üí cleaner interface)
SlackEventDefinitions   // Event type definitions only
SlackPayloadTypes      // Payload structures only
SlackResponseTypes     // Response interfaces only
SlackUtilityTypes      // Helper types only

// PRIORITY 2: SlackInterfaceService Refactoring (1,444 lines ‚Üí 6 focused services)
SlackEventHandler        // Event processing only
SlackOAuthManager       // OAuth handling only
SlackConfirmationHandler // Confirmation processing only
SlackProposalParser     // Proposal extraction only
SlackMessageFormatter   // Message formatting only
SlackContextExtractor   // Context extraction only

// PRIORITY 3: EmailAgent Refactoring (1,738 lines ‚Üí 4 focused handlers)
EmailOperationHandler  // Gmail API operations only
ContactResolver        // Contact resolution only
EmailValidator         // Validation only
EmailFormatter         // Response formatting only

// PRIORITY 4: CalendarAgent Refactoring (1,636 lines ‚Üí 3 focused handlers)
CalendarEventManager   // Event CRUD operations only
AvailabilityChecker    // Availability and scheduling only
CalendarFormatter      // Response formatting only

// PRIORITY 5: SlackAgent Refactoring (1,336 lines ‚Üí 3 focused handlers)
SlackMessageReader     // Message reading only
SlackThreadManager     // Thread management only
SlackContextAnalyzer   // Context analysis only

// PRIORITY 6: MasterAgent Refactoring (1,008 lines ‚Üí 4 focused components)
AIPlanner              // AI planning logic only
ToolOrchestrator       // Tool coordination only
ProposalGenerator      // Proposal creation only
ContextManager         // Context gathering only
```

### Implementation Steps:
