# 🧠 Sophisticated Multi-Agent Architecture

## 🎯 **Vision: Advanced Voice-Controlled AI Assistant**

A sophisticated iOS app where users speak naturally, and a master AI agent intelligently routes requests to specialized sub-agents, each with their own tools and capabilities. The system supports complex multi-step workflows, conversation context, and graceful error handling.

## 🏗️ **Current Architecture Overview**

### **Master Agent System** 🧠
```
User Voice Input → iOS Speech-to-Text → Master Agent → Specialized Agents → Tools → Results
                                          ↓
                                   (OpenAI + Rule-based
                                    Intelligent Routing)
```

### **Multi-Agent Orchestration**
```typescript
MasterAgent {
  // Dual routing system: OpenAI + Rule-based fallback
  processUserInput() → [ToolCall[]]
  
  Routes to:
  ├── EmailAgent (Gmail API integration)
  ├── ContactAgent (Google Contacts/People API)  
  ├── ThinkAgent (Analysis & verification)
  ├── CalendarAgent (placeholder - ready for Google Calendar)
  ├── ContentCreator (placeholder - ready for OpenAI)
  └── TavilyAgent (placeholder - ready for web search)
}
```

## 🔧 **Sophisticated Components**

### **1. Master Agent Intelligence**
**File**: `backend/src/agents/master.agent.ts`

**Advanced Features**:
- **Dual Routing System**: OpenAI GPT-4o-mini + rule-based fallback
- **Multi-tool Orchestration**: Can call multiple agents in one response
- **Context-Aware**: Maintains conversation history via SessionService
- **Smart Contact Resolution**: Automatically chains contact lookup → email sending
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful fallback when OpenAI fails

**Example Workflows**:
```typescript
// Complex multi-step workflow
Input: "send an email to john asking about the meeting"
Master Agent Routes:
1. contactAgent(query: "get contact info for john")
2. emailAgent(query: "send email to john asking about meeting") 
3. Think(query: "verify correct steps")
```

### **2. Specialized Email Agent**
**File**: `backend/src/agents/email.agent.ts`

**Advanced Capabilities**:
- **6 Email Operations**: Send, Reply, Search, Draft, Get Email, Get Thread
- **Natural Language Processing**: Extracts recipients, subject, body from queries
- **Gmail API Integration**: Full OAuth2 authentication + API calls
- **Thread Management**: Handles conversation threads and replies
- **Contact Integration**: Accepts resolved contact info from Contact Agent

**Example Operations**:
```typescript
emailAgent.processQuery({
  query: "send email to john@example.com asking about the quarterly review meeting",
  accessToken: "oauth_token",
  contacts: [{ name: "John", email: "john@example.com" }]
})
```

### **3. Contact Resolution Agent**
**File**: `backend/src/agents/contact.agent.ts`

**Advanced Features**:
- **Google APIs Integration**: Contacts API + People API
- **Fuzzy Matching**: Levenshtein distance for name matching
- **Confidence Scoring**: Ranks contact matches by relevance
- **Email History Analysis**: Finds frequently contacted people
- **Multi-source Data**: User contacts + email interaction history

### **4. Tool Execution Orchestra**
**File**: `backend/src/services/tool-executor.service.ts`

**Orchestration Features**:
- **Sequential Execution**: Executes multiple agents in order
- **Error Handling**: Per-tool error isolation + recovery
- **Performance Monitoring**: Execution time tracking
- **Critical Tool Detection**: Stops on critical failures
- **Result Aggregation**: Combines results from multiple agents

## 📡 **Detailed API Architecture**

### **Current Endpoint Structure**
```typescript
// What you have built so far
POST /api/auth/exchange-token     // OAuth token exchange
POST /api/auth/logout            // User logout
GET  /api/health                 // System health

// What needs to be added for iOS integration
POST /api/assistant/command      // Voice-to-text processing
POST /api/assistant/execute      // Execute confirmed actions
GET  /api/assistant/session/:id  // Session management
```

### **Proposed iOS Integration Endpoints**
```typescript
// Voice Command Processing
POST /api/assistant/process {
  command: string,           // Transcribed voice text
  sessionId: string,         // Conversation session
  context?: {               // Optional context
    lastEmailThread?: string,
    lastCalendarEvent?: string
  }
}

Response: {
  sessionId: string,
  masterAgentResponse: {
    message: string,
    toolCalls: ToolCall[],
    needsThinking: boolean
  },
  proposedActions: ActionPreview[],
  confirmationRequired: boolean
}

// Action Execution (after user confirms)
POST /api/assistant/execute {
  sessionId: string,
  actionId: string,
  confirmed: boolean,
  modifications?: string
}

Response: {
  success: boolean,
  results: ToolResult[],
  message: string,
  executionStats: ExecutionStats
}
```

## 🎤 **iOS Integration Architecture**

### **Sophisticated iOS Components**

```swift
// Speech Processing Layer
SpeechService {
  func startRecording() -> AnyPublisher<String, Error>
  func processTranscription(_ text: String) -> VoiceCommand
}

// API Communication Layer  
APIService {
  func processCommand(_ command: VoiceCommand) -> AnyPublisher<AssistantResponse, Error>
  func executeAction(_ action: ActionPreview) -> AnyPublisher<ExecutionResult, Error>
  func getSessionHistory(_ sessionId: String) -> AnyPublisher<SessionContext, Error>
}

// State Management
AssistantState {
  @Published var currentSession: SessionContext?
  @Published var pendingActions: [ActionPreview]
  @Published var executionResults: [ExecutionResult]
  @Published var conversationHistory: [ConversationEntry]
}

// UI Layer
MainAssistantView {
  VoiceInputComponent()          // Sophisticated recording UI
  ActionPreviewComponent()       // Rich action previews
  ConfirmationComponent()        // Smart confirmation flow
  ConversationHistoryView()      // Context-aware history
  ExecutionStatusView()          // Real-time execution feedback
}
```

### **Advanced iOS User Experience**

```swift
// Sophisticated Voice Flow
1. User taps and holds record button
2. Visual waveform feedback during recording
3. Real-time transcription display
4. Release button → processing indicator
5. Action preview with rich context:
   "Send email to John Smith (john@company.com)
    Subject: Quarterly Review Meeting
    Body: Hi John, I wanted to ask about..."
6. Contextual confirmation options:
   [Send] [Edit] [Cancel] [Add to Calendar]
7. Execution with progress tracking
8. Success confirmation with follow-up options
```

→ Calendar Agent: Create meeting for "next Tuesday"  
→ Email Agent: Send invites with calendar attachment
→ Think Agent: Verify all steps completed successfully

// Context-aware testing
"Reply to the last email saying I'll be there"
