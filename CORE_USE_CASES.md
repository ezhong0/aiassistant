# Core Use Cases: Education & Enrichment Coordinator Commands

This document contains example natural language commands that coordinators at education and enrichment programs should be able to execute through the AI assistant. All examples focus exclusively on tutoring centers, music studios, dance schools, art programs, sports instruction, and language schools.

**Key principle:** The AI understands natural language. You don't need formal templates or CSV files (though you can use them if you prefer). Just describe what you want in plain English.

## Understanding Request Framework

### ✅ **SUPPORTED Requests** (Google Workspace APIs Only)

**Core Capabilities:**
- **Email Operations**: Search, draft, send, organize emails using Gmail API
- **Calendar Management**: Schedule sessions, check availability, manage events using Calendar API
- **Contact Management**: Look up, organize, and manage contacts using Contacts API
- **Bulk Operations**: Send mass emails and schedule multiple sessions via API calls
- **Natural Language Understanding**: Parse any type of input - lists, descriptions, pasted templates, or structured data
- **Data Analysis**: Analyze available data from emails, calendar, and contacts to provide insights
- **Data Synthesis**: Combine information from multiple sources to create comprehensive reports
- **Complex Workflows**: Multi-step processes accomplished through API sequences

**What Makes Requests Supported:**
- **API-Feasible**: Can be accomplished using only Gmail API, Calendar API, and Contacts API
- **Data Available**: Required information exists within Google Workspace or user provides it naturally
- **No External Dependencies**: Doesn't require access to external systems or services
- **Flexible Input**: Works with any form of input - natural language, lists, templates, or structured data

**Examples of Supported Requests:**
- "Send welcome emails to Emma, Lucas, Sophia, and the other new students saying I'm excited to work with them"
- "Schedule makeup sessions with students who cancelled this week, checking instructor availability"
- "Analyze parent feedback emails from last month and categorize by theme"
- "Coordinate the recital: invitations, rehearsal scheduling, logistics emails, reminders"
- "Send progress updates to all my Tuesday students highlighting their improvements"
- "Schedule parent conferences with everyone avoiding conflicts"
- **Or with structured data:** "Send these 80 students personalized emails using this template [paste] and data [attach spreadsheet]"

---

### ❌ **UNSUPPORTED Requests** (Require External Systems)

**External System Dependencies:**
These require integrations beyond Google Workspace:
- Learning management systems (Canvas, Moodle, Schoology) - requires LMS API
- Payment processing (Stripe, PayPal, Square) - requires payment processor API
- Student information systems (PowerSchool, Infinite Campus) - requires SIS API
- Booking/scheduling platforms (Calendly, Acuity) - requires booking system API
- CRM systems (Salesforce, HubSpot) - requires CRM API
- Video conferencing (Zoom, Teams) - requires video platform API
- Attendance tracking systems - requires attendance system API

**Data Not Available in Google Workspace:**
- Student grades and academic records (requires LMS or SIS)
- Tuition payment history and billing data (requires payment processor or accounting system)
- Real-time attendance data (requires attendance tracking system)
- Student assessment scores (requires testing/assessment platform)
- Learning analytics and engagement metrics (requires LMS)

**System Creation Requirements:**
These require persistent infrastructure we don't provide:
- Building databases, dashboards, or automated workflows
- Creating persistent student progress tracking systems
- Setting up automated triggers that run independently
- Real-time monitoring and alerting systems
- Automated follow-up systems without user initiation

**Examples of Unsupported Requests:**
- "Automatically track student progress across all sessions" ❌ (requires external tracking system)
- "Process tuition payments and update billing records" ❌ (requires payment processor)
- "Set up automated reminders that send every week without me initiating" ❌ (requires automation infrastructure)
- "Pull student grades from Canvas and email parents" ❌ (requires LMS integration)
- "Update student attendance in PowerSchool" ❌ (requires SIS integration)
- "Create a dashboard showing real-time student engagement" ❌ (requires external system)
- "Monitor parent emails 24/7 and alert me to urgent issues" ❌ (requires real-time monitoring infrastructure)
- "Automatically send progress updates when students complete assignments" ❌ (requires LMS integration + automation)

**Note:** These unsupported requests require external systems or persistent automation. But you CAN ask: "Send progress updates to all students who completed assignments this week" (if you tell us who they are or we can find them in your calendar/emails).

---

### **Making Requests Work Within Constraints**

**Instead of requesting external system integration, provide data naturally:**

| ❌ Won't Work | ✅ Will Work |
|---------------|-------------|
| "Pull grades from Canvas and email parents" | "Send progress updates to Emma, Lucas, and Sophia about their recent test scores" OR "Here's grade data [attach] - send updates to all parents" |
| "Automatically track attendance and notify parents" | "Send attendance notifications to parents of students who missed this week" OR "Here's attendance data [attach] - notify these families" |
| "Process payments through Stripe" | "Send payment confirmations to the families who paid this week" OR "Use this confirmation template [paste] and send to these families" |
| "Set up automated weekly reminders" | "Send reminder emails to all students about practice goals" (you initiate when needed) |
| "Build a student progress dashboard" | "Analyze my calendar and emails from last month and summarize student progress" |
| "Integrate with our booking system" | "Schedule makeup sessions for Emma, Lucas, and Sophia next week" |
| "Monitor inbox 24/7 for urgent emails" | "Search my inbox for urgent parent emails and summarize them" |

**Key Principles:**
1. **Google Workspace Only**: Limited to Gmail, Calendar, and Contacts API functionality
2. **User-Initiated Actions**: All operations initiated by coordinator commands, not automated triggers
3. **Flexible Input**: Natural language, lists, pasted templates, or structured data files - whatever works for you
4. **No Persistent State**: Cannot maintain databases or tracking systems outside Google Workspace
5. **API-Feasible Only**: Can accomplish any task achievable through Google Workspace API calls
6. **LLM Understands Context**: You don't need formal structure - just describe what you want

### **Workflow Patterns That Work**

**✅ Multi-Step Workflows (All Google Workspace-based):**
- "Handle student onboarding: welcome email → orientation scheduling → materials email → first session booking"
- "Process cancellations: notify students → find makeup times → send options → confirm bookings"
- "Coordinate recital: invitations → RSVP tracking → rehearsal scheduling → logistics emails → reminders"
- "Monthly routine: progress updates → payment reminders → schedule confirmations → feedback collection"

**✅ Bulk Operations (Natural or Structured):**
- "Send personalized emails to all my students saying they had a great week"
- "Schedule sessions with all new students next week"
- "Notify all families about the schedule change"
- **Or with files:** "Send 100 emails using this template [paste] and data [attach spreadsheet]"

**✅ Analysis and Reporting:**
- "Analyze all parent emails from last month and identify common concerns"
- "Review calendar data and report on session attendance patterns"
- "Summarize all feedback and create categories of improvement areas"

**✅ Context-Aware Communication:**
- "Reply to this parent email about scheduling with my available times"
- "Send progress update to Emma's parents mentioning the progress we discussed last time"
- "Reply to makeup session requests with times that work for me and the instructor"
- "Tell Emma's parents she's really improved on the thing we were working on"
