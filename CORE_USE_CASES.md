# Core Use Cases: Independent Consultant Commands

This document contains example natural language commands that independent consultants and freelancers should be able to execute through the AI assistant. All examples focus on client acquisition, project delivery, relationship management, and business operations.

**Key principle:** The AI understands natural language. You don't need formal templates or CSV files (though you can use them if you prefer). Just describe what you want in plain English.
