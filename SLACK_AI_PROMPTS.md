# 🤖 Slack AI Assistant - AI Prompts Guide

## 🎯 **Overview**

This document contains **strategic AI prompts** to help you build your Slack AI Assistant step-by-step. Each prompt is designed to leverage your existing architecture while adding Slack-specific functionality.

**Key Principle**: Your existing multi-agent system and services are 80% of what you need. We're just adding the Slack interface layer (not a service) for now, with room for future web interfaces.

---

## 🚨 **IMPORTANT: Current Status Reality Check**

### **What You've Actually Completed:**
- ✅ **Architecture Design** (90% complete)
- ✅ **Service vs. Interface Distinction** (implemented)

### **Bottom Line:**
**You have successfully implemented the core Slack integration!** OAuth authentication is working, email sending is functional, and the basic Slack-to-agent workflow is complete. Focus now shifts to enhancement and optimization.

---

## ✅ **PROMPTS CORRECTED FOR YOUR ARCHITECTURE**

### **All prompts have been updated to align with your actual architecture:**
- **SlackInterface** (not SlackService) - follows interface layer pattern
- **ServiceManager access** (not integration) - receives ServiceManager to access services
- **MasterAgent routing** (not intent parsing) - routes requests, doesn't parse intent
- **Existing agent integration** (not modification) - tests existing agents with Slack context

### **Key Changes Made:**
1. **Prompt 3**: Now asks you to implement SlackInterface (not create SlackService)
2. **Prompt 4**: Focuses on completing event handling in existing SlackInterface
3. **Prompt 5**: Asks you to complete MasterAgent integration (not implement routing)
4. **Prompts 9-11**: Focus on testing existing agents (not modifying them)
5. **All prompts**: Reference your actual architecture, not the old service-based approach

### **💡 Key Insight**
Your **architecture-first approach is working perfectly** - you've designed the right foundation. Now you need to **implement the actual Slack integration** using that solid architecture. The remaining work is about **building on your excellent foundation** rather than fixing architectural issues.

## 🏗️ **Architecture Approach**

### **Service vs. Interface Layer Distinction** 🎯
- **Slack is NOT a service** - it's an interface layer
- **Services** (Gmail, Calendar, Auth) maintain state and provide functionality
- **Interfaces** (Slack, Web) handle input/output and route requests
- **Slack routes to existing services** through MasterAgent, doesn't duplicate logic

### **Intent Parsing: Master Agent Only** ✅
- **Master Agent handles ALL intent parsing** through existing OpenAI integration
- **Slack interface does NOT parse intent** - it only handles events and routing
- **Same intent parsing logic** serves Slack interface and future web interfaces
- **No duplication** of complex intent recognition logic

### **Flow Architecture**
```
Slack Event → SlackInterface → MasterAgent (intent parsing) → Specialized Agents → SlackFormatter → Slack Response
     ↓              ↓                    ↓                              ↓                ↓              ↓
  Event        Context            Intent Parsing                    Execution        Formatting      Response
  Handling     Translation        (Already Working)                & Results       for Slack       to User
```

### **Why This Approach Works**
1. **Single Source of Truth**: Master Agent is the only place intent parsing happens
2. **Consistent Behavior**: Same logic for Slack users and future interfaces
3. **Maintainability**: One place to update intent parsing logic
4. **Testing**: Test intent parsing once, works everywhere
5. **Strategic Alignment**: Follows your architecture-first approach

# 🏗️ **Backend Changes Required for Slack Integration**

## Overview

Your existing backend has excellent architecture with multi-agent system, service registry, and middleware stack. To add Slack integration, we need to create a new Slack service layer that leverages your existing agents and infrastructure.

## ✅ **Critical Logic Changes COMPLETED**

### **1. Slack Service Integration Flow** ✅ **FIXED**

**Previous Problem in `slack.service.ts`:**
```typescript
// ❌ WRONG: Trying to use ToolExecutorService directly
private async routeToAgent(request: SlackAgentRequest): Promise<SlackAgentResponse> {
  const toolExecutorService = this.serviceManager.getService('ToolExecutorService');
  // ... trying to execute tools directly
}
```

**Now Fixed:**
```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT: Route to MasterAgent for intent parsing
private async routeToAgent(request: SlackAgentRequest): Promise<SlackAgentResponse> {
  const masterAgent = new MasterAgent();
  const response = await masterAgent.processUserInput(
    request.message, 
    request.context.sessionId, 
    request.context.userId
  );
  // Then use ToolExecutorService for execution
}
```

### **2. Session Management Integration** ✅ **FIXED**

**Previous Problem:** Slack service didn't integrate with existing session management.

**Now Implemented:**
```typescript
// Added to SlackService
private async createOrGetSession(slackContext: SlackContext): Promise<string> {
  const sessionService = this.serviceManager.getService<SessionService>('sessionService');
  const sessionId = `slack_${slackContext.teamId}_${slackContext.userId}_${slackContext.threadId || 'main'}`;
  return sessionService.getOrCreateSession(sessionId, slackContext.userId);
}
```

### **3. Tool Execution Context** ✅ **FIXED**

**Previous Problem:** Slack context not flowing through to tool execution.

**Now Implemented in `src/types/tools.ts`:**
```typescript
// Extended ToolExecutionContext to include Slack context
interface ToolExecutionContext {
  sessionId: string;
  userId?: string;
  timestamp: Date;
  slackContext?: SlackContext; // ✅ ADDED
}
```

### **4. Agent Response Formatting** ✅ **FIXED**

**Previous Problem:** Agents returned generic responses, not Slack-formatted ones.

**Now Implemented in `src/services/slack-formatter.service.ts`:**
```typescript
// Added formatAgentResponse method for converting agent responses to Slack format
async formatAgentResponse(
  masterResponse: any, 
  slackContext: any
): Promise<{ text: string; blocks?: any[] }> {
  // Formats agent responses with rich Slack Block Kit formatting
  // Includes interactive buttons and proper Slack message structure
}
```

### **5. Service Registration Order** ✅ **FIXED**

**Previous Problem:** Slack service wasn't properly registered in dependency chain.

**Now Implemented in `src/services/service-initialization.ts`:**
```typescript
// Slack service properly registered with dependencies
const slackService = new SlackService(config, serviceManager);
serviceManager.registerService('slackService', slackService, {
  dependencies: ['sessionService', 'toolExecutorService', 'authService', 'calendarService', 'slackFormatterService'],
  priority: 90,
  autoStart: true
});
```

## 🔧 **Specific Files That Need Changes**

### **1. `src/services/slack.service.ts` (Currently disabled)**
- **Fix routing logic** to use MasterAgent instead of direct tool execution
- **Add session management** integration
- **Add proper error handling** that matches existing patterns

### **2. `src/types/tools.ts`**
- **Extend `ToolExecutionContext`** to include Slack context
- **Add Slack-specific types** for responses

### **3. `src/framework/base-agent.ts`**
- **Add Slack context support** in tool execution
- **Add response formatting** methods for Slack

### **4. `src/services/service-initialization.ts`**
- **Register SlackService** with proper dependencies
- **Set correct initialization order**

### **5. `src/index.ts`**
- **Enable Slack routes** (currently commented out)
- **Add Slack middleware** integration

## Required Backend Changes

### 1. Install Slack Dependencies

```bash
cd backend
npm install @slack/bolt @slack/web-api
npm install --save-dev @types/slack__bolt
```

### 2. New Slack-Specific Files to Create

#### A. Slack Service (src/services/slack.service.ts)

- Main service extending BaseService
- Handles Slack App initialization with Bolt SDK
- Manages event subscriptions and OAuth flow
- Integrates with existing service registry pattern

#### B. Slack Event Handler (src/services/slack-event.service.ts)

- Process Slack events: app_mention, message.im, slash commands
- Route events to existing MasterAgent (which already handles intent parsing)
- Handle Slack-specific context (user, channel, thread)
- NO intent parsing - delegate to MasterAgent

#### C. Slack Formatter Service (src/services/slack-formatter.service.ts)

- Convert agent responses to Slack Block Kit format
- Create rich interactive messages with buttons
- Format email/calendar data for Slack display
- Handle error messages and confirmations

#### D. Slack Types (src/types/slack.types.ts)

- TypeScript interfaces for Slack events, contexts, responses
- Integration with existing tool/agent type system

#### E. Slack Routes (src/routes/slack.routes.ts)

- `/slack/events` - Event subscriptions endpoint
- `/slack/oauth/callback` - OAuth callback handler
- `/slack/commands` - Slash command endpoint
- `/slack/interactive` - Button/modal interactions

### 3. Extend Existing Agents

#### Agent Extensions (Minor Changes)

- Add Slack context handling to existing agents
- Support Slack user/channel information in tool execution
- Maintain existing functionality for future interfaces
- NO intent parsing logic - agents only handle execution

#### Master Agent Integration

- **NO changes needed** - existing intent parsing and routing works perfectly
- Slack events will be processed same as future web requests
- MasterAgent already handles all the complex logic

### 4. Environment Configuration

Add to .env:
```bash
# Slack Configuration
SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET=your_signing_secret
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-your-bot-token
SLACK_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
SLACK_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/slack/oauth/callback
```

### 5. Service Registration

Update src/services/service-initialization.ts:
- Register SlackService with service manager
- Add proper dependency order (after auth, before routes)

### 6. Main App Integration

Update src/index.ts:
- Add Slack routes to middleware stack
- Maintain existing route order and security

## Key Integration Points

### Leverage Existing Architecture ✅

- **MasterAgent intent parsing** (already implemented and working)
- Service registry pattern for dependency injection
- Existing middleware stack (auth, rate limiting, logging)
- Current agent system (Master, Email, Contact, Calendar)
- Session management and tool execution

## Architecture Flow

```
Slack Event → SlackService → MasterAgent (existing intent parsing) → Specialized Agents → SlackFormatter → Slack Response
     ↓              ↓                    ↓                              ↓                ↓              ↓
  Event        Context            Intent Parsing                    Execution        Formatting      Response
  Handling     Translation        (Already Working)                & Results       for Slack       to User
```

This plan leverages your sophisticated existing backend (**80% reuse** - MasterAgent + agents + services) while adding focused Slack integration layer (**20% new code** - event handling + formatting).

## 💡 **Key Architectural Principle**

**Remember:** The Slack service should be a **thin interface layer** that:
- ✅ **Receives Slack events**
- ✅ **Translates context** to internal format
- ✅ **Routes to MasterAgent** for intent parsing
- ✅ **Formats responses** for Slack display

**NOT:**
- ❌ **Parse intent** (MasterAgent does this)
- ❌ **Execute tools directly** (ToolExecutorService does this)
- ❌ **Manage sessions** (SessionService does this)

This approach ensures **80% code reuse** while adding only the **20% Slack interface layer** needed.
