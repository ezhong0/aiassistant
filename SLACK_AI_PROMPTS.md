# ü§ñ Slack AI Assistant - AI Prompts Guide

## üéØ **Overview**

This document contains **strategic AI prompts** to help you build your Slack AI Assistant step-by-step. Each prompt is designed to leverage your existing architecture while adding Slack-specific functionality.

**Key Principle**: Your existing multi-agent system and services are 80% of what you need. We're just adding the Slack interface layer (not a service) for now, with room for future web interfaces.

## üèóÔ∏è **Architecture Approach**

### **Service vs. Interface Layer Distinction** üéØ
- **Slack is NOT a service** - it's an interface layer
- **Services** (Gmail, Calendar, Auth) maintain state and provide functionality
- **Interfaces** (Slack, Web) handle input/output and route requests
- **Slack routes to existing services** through MasterAgent, doesn't duplicate logic

### **Intent Parsing: Master Agent Only** ‚úÖ
- **Master Agent handles ALL intent parsing** through existing OpenAI integration
- **Slack interface does NOT parse intent** - it only handles events and routing
- **Same intent parsing logic** serves Slack interface and future web interfaces
- **No duplication** of complex intent recognition logic

### **Flow Architecture**
```
Slack Event ‚Üí SlackService ‚Üí MasterAgent (intent parsing) ‚Üí Specialized Agents ‚Üí SlackFormatter ‚Üí Slack Response
     ‚Üì              ‚Üì                    ‚Üì                              ‚Üì                ‚Üì              ‚Üì
  Event        Context            Intent Parsing                    Execution        Formatting      Response
  Handling     Translation        (Already Working)                & Results       for Slack       to User
```

### **Why This Approach Works**
1. **Single Source of Truth**: Master Agent is the only place intent parsing happens
2. **Consistent Behavior**: Same logic for Slack users and future interfaces
3. **Maintainability**: One place to update intent parsing logic
4. **Testing**: Test intent parsing once, works everywhere
5. **Strategic Alignment**: Follows your architecture-first approach

## üöÄ **Phase 1: Slack Integration Foundation (Weeks 1-3)**

### **Week 1: Slack App Setup & Basic Integration**

#### **Prompt 1: Slack App Configuration**
```
I need to create a Slack app for my AI Assistant platform. I have an existing backend with:
- Multi-agent system (Master, Email, Contact, Calendar agents)
- Google services (Gmail, Contacts, Calendar APIs)
- Express.js backend with TypeScript
- OAuth 2.0 authentication system

Please help me:
1. Create a Slack app in the developer console with the right permissions
2. Configure the necessary bot token scopes for:
   - Reading messages and mentions
   - Sending messages
   - Slash commands
   - Direct message access
3. Set up OAuth 2.0 redirect URLs
4. Configure event subscriptions for app_mention and message.im
5. Add a slash command /assistant

What are the exact steps and configuration values I need?
```

#### **Prompt 2: Install Slack Dependencies**
```
I'm adding Slack integration to my existing Node.js/TypeScript backend. I need to:

1. Install the Slack Bolt SDK and related packages
2. Add the necessary type definitions
3. Update my package.json with the new dependencies

My current backend is in the `backend/` directory with a standard Node.js setup. Please provide the exact npm commands and any package.json updates needed.
```

#### **Prompt 3: Create Slack Service Structure**
```
I need to create a SlackService that integrates with my existing architecture. I have:

- BaseService class that all services extend
- ServiceManager for dependency injection
- Existing services: GmailService, ContactService, CalendarService
- Multi-agent system with MasterAgent routing

Please create:
1. `src/services/slack.service.ts` - Main Slack integration service
2. `src/types/slack.types.ts` - Slack-specific type definitions  
3. `src/middleware/slack.middleware.ts` - Slack event processing middleware

The SlackService should:
- Extend BaseService following my existing pattern
- Handle Slack events (mentions, DMs, slash commands)
- Integrate with my existing ServiceManager
- Follow my established error handling and logging patterns

Reference my existing services like GmailService for the exact patterns to follow.
```

#### **Prompt 4: Basic Slack Event Handling**
```
I need to implement basic Slack event handling in my SlackService. I have the Slack Bolt SDK installed and basic service structure.

Please help me implement:
1. App mention handler (@assistant)
2. Direct message handler
3. Slash command handler (/assistant)
4. Basic response sending functionality

The service should:
- Use the Slack Bolt App pattern
- Handle events asynchronously

- Log events using my existing logger pattern
- Follow my established error handling from BaseService

Show me the complete implementation with proper TypeScript types and error handling.
```

### **Week 2: Event Processing & Routing**

#### **Prompt 5: Intent Recognition & Agent Routing**
```
I need to connect Slack events to my existing agent system. I have:

- MasterAgent that already handles intent parsing and routing to specialized agents
- EmailAgent, ContactAgent, CalendarAgent (extends BaseAgent)
- Existing intent recognition through OpenAI integration
- Tool execution system for agent operations

Please help me implement:
1. Route Slack events to my existing MasterAgent (which already handles intent parsing)
2. Handle Slack-specific context (user ID, channel, thread) in the routing
3. Convert agent responses back to Slack format
4. Maintain the existing intent parsing logic in MasterAgent

The flow should be:
Slack Event ‚Üí SlackService ‚Üí MasterAgent (intent parsing) ‚Üí Execute with Existing Agents ‚Üí SlackFormatter ‚Üí Slack Response

IMPORTANT: Do NOT implement intent parsing in the Slack layer. The MasterAgent already handles this through OpenAI integration. The Slack service should only handle event reception, context translation, and response formatting.

Show me how to route Slack events to my existing MasterAgent and how to handle Slack context without duplicating intent parsing logic.
```

#### **Prompt 6: Slack Context Management**
```
I need to implement Slack conversation context management that integrates with my existing MasterAgent system. I have:

IMPORTANT: The context management should integrate with my existing MasterAgent's session handling, not replace it. The MasterAgent should receive Slack context (user, channel, thread) to enhance its intent parsing while maintaining existing conversation state.

Show me the database schema additions and service modifications needed to integrate Slack context with my existing MasterAgent session management.
```

### **Week 3: Response Formatting & Context Management**

#### **Prompt 7: Slack Formatter Service**
```

# üèóÔ∏è **Backend Changes Required for Slack Integration**

## Overview

Your existing backend has excellent architecture with multi-agent system, service registry, and middleware stack. To add Slack integration, we need to create a new Slack service layer that leverages your existing agents and infrastructure.

## ‚úÖ **Critical Logic Changes COMPLETED**

### **1. Slack Service Integration Flow** ‚úÖ **FIXED**

**Previous Problem in `slack.service.ts`:**
```typescript
// ‚ùå WRONG: Trying to use ToolExecutorService directly
private async routeToAgent(request: SlackAgentRequest): Promise<SlackAgentResponse> {
  const toolExecutorService = this.serviceManager.getService('ToolExecutorService');
  // ... trying to execute tools directly
}
```

**Now Fixed:**
```typescript
// ‚úÖ CORRECT: Route to MasterAgent for intent parsing
private async routeToAgent(request: SlackAgentRequest): Promise<SlackAgentResponse> {
  const masterAgent = new MasterAgent();
  const response = await masterAgent.processUserInput(
    request.message, 
    request.context.sessionId, 
    request.context.userId
  );
  // Then use ToolExecutorService for execution
}
```

### **2. Session Management Integration** ‚úÖ **FIXED**

**Previous Problem:** Slack service didn't integrate with existing session management.

**Now Implemented:**
```typescript
// Added to SlackService
private async createOrGetSession(slackContext: SlackContext): Promise<string> {
  const sessionService = this.serviceManager.getService<SessionService>('sessionService');
  const sessionId = `slack_${slackContext.teamId}_${slackContext.userId}_${slackContext.threadId || 'main'}`;
  return sessionService.getOrCreateSession(sessionId, slackContext.userId);
}
```

### **3. Tool Execution Context** ‚úÖ **FIXED**

**Previous Problem:** Slack context not flowing through to tool execution.

**Now Implemented in `src/types/tools.ts`:**
```typescript
// Extended ToolExecutionContext to include Slack context
interface ToolExecutionContext {
  sessionId: string;
  userId?: string;
  timestamp: Date;
  slackContext?: SlackContext; // ‚úÖ ADDED
}
```

### **4. Agent Response Formatting** ‚úÖ **FIXED**

**Previous Problem:** Agents returned generic responses, not Slack-formatted ones.

**Now Implemented in `src/services/slack-formatter.service.ts`:**
```typescript
// Added formatAgentResponse method for converting agent responses to Slack format
async formatAgentResponse(
  masterResponse: any, 
  slackContext: any
): Promise<{ text: string; blocks?: any[] }> {
  // Formats agent responses with rich Slack Block Kit formatting
  // Includes interactive buttons and proper Slack message structure
}
```

### **5. Service Registration Order** ‚úÖ **FIXED**

**Previous Problem:** Slack service wasn't properly registered in dependency chain.

**Now Implemented in `src/services/service-initialization.ts`:**
```typescript
// Slack service properly registered with dependencies
const slackService = new SlackService(config, serviceManager);
serviceManager.registerService('slackService', slackService, {
  dependencies: ['sessionService', 'toolExecutorService', 'authService', 'calendarService', 'slackFormatterService'],
  priority: 90,
  autoStart: true
});
```

## üîß **Specific Files That Need Changes**

### **1. `src/services/slack.service.ts` (Currently disabled)**
- **Fix routing logic** to use MasterAgent instead of direct tool execution
- **Add session management** integration
- **Add proper error handling** that matches existing patterns

### **4. `src/services/service-initialization.ts`**
- **Register SlackService** with proper dependencies
- **Set correct initialization order**

### **5. `src/index.ts`**
- **Enable Slack routes** (currently commented out)
- **Add Slack middleware** integration

## Required Backend Changes

### 1. Install Slack Dependencies

```bash
cd backend
npm install @slack/bolt @slack/web-api
npm install --save-dev @types/slack__bolt
```

### 2. New Slack-Specific Files to Create

#### A. Slack Service (src/services/slack.service.ts)

- Main service extending BaseService
- Handles Slack App initialization with Bolt SDK
- Manages event subscriptions and OAuth flow
- Integrates with existing service registry pattern

#### B. Slack Event Handler (src/services/slack-event.service.ts)

- Process Slack events: app_mention, message.im, slash commands
- Route events to existing MasterAgent (which already handles intent parsing)
- Handle Slack-specific context (user, channel, thread)
- NO intent parsing - delegate to MasterAgent

#### C. Slack Formatter Service (src/services/slack-formatter.service.ts)

- Convert agent responses to Slack Block Kit format
- Create rich interactive messages with buttons
- Format email/calendar data for Slack display
- Handle error messages and confirmations

#### D. Slack Types (src/types/slack.types.ts)

- TypeScript interfaces for Slack events, contexts, responses
- Integration with existing tool/agent type system

#### E. Slack Routes (src/routes/slack.routes.ts)

- `/slack/events` - Event subscriptions endpoint
- `/slack/oauth/callback` - OAuth callback handler
- `/slack/commands` - Slash command endpoint
- `/slack/interactive` - Button/modal interactions

### 3. Extend Existing Agents

#### Agent Extensions (Minor Changes)

- Add Slack context handling to existing agents
- Support Slack user/channel information in tool execution
- Maintain existing functionality for future interfaces
- NO intent parsing logic - agents only handle execution

#### Master Agent Integration

- **NO changes needed** - existing intent parsing and routing works perfectly
- Slack events will be processed same as future web requests
- MasterAgent already handles all the complex logic

### 4. Environment Configuration

Add to .env:
```bash
# Slack Configuration
SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET=your_signing_secret
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-your-bot-token
SLACK_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
SLACK_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/slack/oauth/callback
```

### 5. Service Registration

Update src/services/service-initialization.ts:
- Register SlackService with service manager
- Add proper dependency order (after auth, before routes)

### 6. Main App Integration

Update src/index.ts:
- Add Slack routes to middleware stack
- Maintain existing route order and security

## Key Integration Points

### Leverage Existing Architecture ‚úÖ

- **MasterAgent intent parsing** (already implemented and working)
- Service registry pattern for dependency injection
- Existing middleware stack (auth, rate limiting, logging)
- Current agent system (Master, Email, Contact, Calendar)
- Session management and tool execution

### Slack-Specific Additions üÜï

- Slack Bolt SDK integration
- Block Kit message formatting
- Event subscription handling
- Interactive component processing
- Slack context flow to MasterAgent

### No Breaking Changes ‚úÖ

- Future web interfaces can be added easily
- Existing API endpoints remain functional
- Current agent interfaces preserved
- MasterAgent continues handling all intent parsing

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Week 1**: Core Slack service and basic event handling (delegating to MasterAgent)
2. **Week 2**: Agent integration and response formatting (no intent parsing changes)
3. **Week 3**: Interactive components and OAuth flow
4. **Week 4**: Testing and polish

## üéØ **Implementation Status**

### **Phase 1: Core Integration** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED (Week 1)**
1. **Slack service routing** ‚úÖ Fixed - now uses MasterAgent
2. **Session management integration** ‚úÖ Implemented
3. **Tool execution context** ‚úÖ Extended for Slack

### **Phase 2: Response Formatting** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED (Week 1)**
1. **Slack formatting** ‚úÖ Added to SlackFormatterService
2. **SlackFormatterService** ‚úÖ Created with rich response formatting
3. **End-to-end flow** ‚úÖ Ready for testing

### **Phase 3: Polish & Testing** üîÑ **IN PROGRESS (Week 2)**
1. **Interactive components** üîÑ Ready for implementation
2. **Comprehensive testing** üîÑ Ready to begin
3. **Performance optimization** üîÑ Ready to begin

## Architecture Flow

```
Slack Event ‚Üí SlackService ‚Üí MasterAgent (existing intent parsing) ‚Üí Specialized Agents ‚Üí SlackFormatter ‚Üí Slack Response
     ‚Üì              ‚Üì                    ‚Üì                              ‚Üì                ‚Üì              ‚Üì
  Event        Context            Intent Parsing                    Execution        Formatting      Response
  Handling     Translation        (Already Working)                & Results       for Slack       to User
```

This plan leverages your sophisticated existing backend (**80% reuse** - MasterAgent + agents + services) while adding focused Slack integration layer (**20% new code** - event handling + formatting).

## üí° **Key Architectural Principle**

**Remember:** The Slack service should be a **thin interface layer** that:
- ‚úÖ **Receives Slack events**
- ‚úÖ **Translates context** to internal format
- ‚úÖ **Routes to MasterAgent** for intent parsing
- ‚úÖ **Formats responses** for Slack display

**NOT:**
- ‚ùå **Parse intent** (MasterAgent does this)
- ‚ùå **Execute tools directly** (ToolExecutorService does this)
- ‚ùå **Manage sessions** (SessionService does this)

This approach ensures **80% code reuse** while adding only the **20% Slack interface layer** needed.
