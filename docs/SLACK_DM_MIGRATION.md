# Slack DM-Only Migration Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the migration strategy for transitioning AI Assistant from channel-based interactions to DM-only mode, ensuring enhanced privacy and security while maintaining user experience.

## Migration Goals

1. **Privacy Enhancement**: Move all AI Assistant interactions to direct messages
2. **Security Improvement**: Eliminate channel-based data exposure
3. **User Experience**: Maintain functionality while improving privacy
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Graceful transition for existing users

## Migration Modes

### 1. Graceful Migration (Default)
- **Duration**: 7-14 days transition period
- **Notifications**: Admin notifications + user guidance
- **Behavior**: Channel interactions redirect to DM with helpful messages
- **Rollback**: Possible during transition period

### 2. Immediate Migration
- **Duration**: Instant enforcement
- **Notifications**: Minimal user guidance only
- **Behavior**: Channel interactions immediately rejected
- **Rollback**: Not recommended

### 3. Disabled Migration
- **Duration**: No migration
- **Notifications**: None
- **Behavior**: Maintains current channel-based functionality
- **Rollback**: N/A

## Implementation Details

### OAuth Scope Changes

**Previous Scopes:**
```
app_mentions:read, chat:write, commands, im:history, im:read, im:write, users:read, channels:read
```

**New DM-Only Scopes:**
```
im:history, im:write, users:read, chat:write, commands
```

**Removed Scopes:**
- `app_mentions:read` - No longer needed for channel mentions
- `channels:read` - No longer needed for channel access
- `im:read` - Redundant with `im:history`

### Event Handling Changes

#### Channel Interaction Rejection
```typescript
// Enforce DM-only mode - reject channel-based interactions
if (!slackContext.isDirectMessage) {
  logger.warn('Channel interaction rejected - DM-only mode enforced', {
    eventId, eventType: event.type, userId: event.user, channelId: event.channel
  });
  
  // Send polite redirect message
  await this.client.chat.postMessage({
    channel: slackContext.channelId,
    text: "ðŸ”’ AI Assistant works exclusively through direct messages to protect your privacy. Please send me a direct message to get assistance.",
    thread_ts: slackContext.threadTs
  });
  return;
}
```

#### User Guidance Messages
- **Installation Page**: Updated to emphasize DM-only usage
- **Welcome Messages**: Include privacy protection messaging
- **Help Commands**: Updated to reflect DM-only interaction methods

### Migration Service Features

#### Admin Notifications
- Automatic notification to workspace administrators
- Explanation of privacy benefits
- User guidance for the transition

#### User Guidance
- Channel interaction redirects with helpful messages
- Direct message initiation buttons
- Privacy protection explanations

#### Migration Status Tracking
- Workspace migration status
- Admin notification status
- Migration mode tracking

## User Experience Changes

### Before Migration
- Users could mention @AI Assistant in channels
- Channel conversations were visible to all members
- Mixed privacy concerns

### After Migration
- All interactions happen through direct messages
- Complete privacy protection
- Enhanced security for sensitive operations

### Transition Experience
1. **Channel Mention**: User gets polite redirect message
2. **Direct Message**: Full functionality available
3. **Slash Commands**: Continue to work as before
4. **Help Requests**: Updated guidance for DM usage

## Rollback Strategy

### Graceful Migration Rollback
1. **Timeline**: Within 7 days of migration start
2. **Process**: 
   - Revert OAuth scopes to include channel permissions
   - Remove DM-only enforcement
   - Restore channel interaction handling
3. **Notification**: Admin notification of rollback

### Immediate Migration Rollback
- **Not Recommended**: Immediate migration should be permanent
- **If Required**: Full workspace reinstallation needed

## Testing Strategy

### Pre-Migration Testing

- [ ] Performance impact assessment
- [ ] Error handling validation

### Test Scenarios
1. **New Installation**: DM-only from start
2. **Existing Workspace**: Graceful migration
3. **Channel Interaction**: Proper rejection and guidance
4. **Direct Message**: Full functionality
5. **Slash Commands**: Continued operation
