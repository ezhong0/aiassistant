## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Technical Risks

#### **Integration API Changes**

- **Mitigation**: Abstract integration layer, maintain multiple CRM options

#### **Workflow Complexity Limits**
- **Risk**: Natural language parsing fails on complex instructions
- **Mitigation**: Start with template-based workflows, gradually increase complexity

#### **Scale Limitations**
- **Risk**: Current architecture can't handle multiple simultaneous workflows

### Market Risks

#### **Customer Acquisition Cost Too High**
- **Risk**: Cost to acquire customers exceeds LTV
- **Mitigation**: Focus on referrals and organic growth, validate channels early

#### **Feature Expectations Too High**
- **Risk**: Customers expect capabilities beyond MVP scope
- **Mitigation**: Clear positioning, demo exactly what works, manage expectations

#### **Competitive Response**
- **Risk**: Zapier or other platforms add AI reasoning capabilities

## Conclusion

This MVP focuses on proving one core hypothesis: **that complex business workflows can be automated through natural language commands better than existing rule-based tools.**

By building on your existing multi-agent architecture and adding strategic integrations, we can validate market demand with minimal additional development while positioning for rapid scaling if successful.

**The key to MVP success is ruthless focus on making 3-5 complex workflows work perfectly rather than trying to handle every possible business process.**
