## 🎯 **Current System Analysis**

### **✅ What's Working Well**
- ✅ **AI-First Architecture**: No keyword matching, everything routed through LLM
- ✅ **Sophisticated Confirmation System**: Preview mode, database storage, natural language confirmations
- ✅ **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Specialized agents for different domains
- ✅ **Context Gathering**: Slack context integration for better understanding

### **❌ Current Limitations**
- ❌ **No Sequential Planning**: Complex requests aren't broken down into logical steps
- ❌ **No Reevaluation**: System doesn't adapt based on new information
- ❌ **Rigid Execution**: Tools execute independently without coordination
- ❌ **Poor Error Recovery**: Failures don't lead to alternative approaches

### **🔍 Specific Problems from User Examples**

**Problem 1**: "find a time for a 2-hour meeting with Sarah and Mike next week"
- **Current**: Single calendarAgent call that fails because contacts aren't resolved
- **Root Cause**: No sequential planning or reevaluation

**Problem 2**: "when am I going to the gym"
- **Current**: Generic error or lists all events instead of finding next gym session
- **Root Cause**: No intelligent plan adaptation based on context

## 🧠 **Core Architecture: Cursor-Like Master Agent**

### **The Cursor Philosophy**
Just like Cursor analyzes codebases, creates plans, and adapts based on what it finds, our Master Agent will:

1. **Analyze** the user request and available tools
2. **Create** a sequential plan with logical steps
3. **Execute** each step and gather results
4. **Reevaluate** the plan based on new information
5. **Adapt** the plan if needed (add steps, change approach, etc.)
6. **Continue** until sufficient information is gathered
7. **Generate** an intelligent response

### **Enhanced Flow**
```
User Input → Intent Analysis → Plan Creation → Sequential Execution → Continuous Reevaluation → Plan Adaptation → Tool Execution → Result Analysis → Response Generation
```

## 🤖 **Intelligent Multi-Agent Architecture**

### **The Multi-Agent Intelligence Model**

Each agent brings **domain expertise** and **reasoning capabilities**, while the Master Agent provides **coordination** and **synthesis**:

- **EmailAgent**: Email domain expertise, Gmail API knowledge, search strategy suggestions
- **CalendarAgent**: Scheduling expertise, availability analysis, meeting optimization
- **ContactAgent**: Contact resolution expertise, relationship understanding, data quality analysis
- **SlackAgent**: Communication context expertise, message analysis, thread understanding
- **MasterAgent**: Workflow coordination, result synthesis, decision making

### **Agent Communication Pattern**

**Natural Language Communication** between Master Agent and subagents:
- Master Agent → Subagent: Natural language requests with context
- Subagent → Master Agent: Natural language responses with analysis and suggestions
- Master Agent: Synthesizes insights and makes decisions about next steps

### **Example: Intelligent Email Search**

```
Master Agent → EmailAgent: "Search for emails about project proposal"
EmailAgent → Master Agent: "I found 3 emails about projects, but none appear to be the actual proposal. Based on my email expertise, I suggest searching older emails or trying different keywords like 'proposal draft' or 'budget proposal'"
Master Agent: "Good analysis! Let's try searching older emails"
Master Agent → EmailAgent: "Search for project proposal from 3-6 months ago"
EmailAgent → Master Agent: "Found it! This email from 4 months ago contains the actual project proposal with budget details and timeline. This matches what users typically look for when searching for 'project proposal'"
Master Agent → User: "Found the project proposal email from 4 months ago"
```

## 🔄 **Natural Language Agent Communication**

The system uses natural language communication between the Master Agent and subagents, leveraging LLMs' strength in natural language understanding:

### **Communication Architecture**
- **Master Agent → Subagents**: Natural language queries
- **Subagents → Master Agent**: Natural language responses
- **Subagents ↔ Subagents**: No direct communication (Master Agent coordinates everything)

### **Example: "when am I going to the gym"**

**Step 1: Intent Analysis**
```
"The user wants to find information regarding their next gym session. This requires searching their calendar for recurring gym events and identifying the next occurrence."
```

**Step 2: Plan Creation**
```
Plan:
1. Search calendar for gym-related events
2. Identify recurring patterns
3. Find the next occurrence
4. Present results in a helpful format
```

**Step 3: Sequential Execution with Natural Language**
```
Master Agent → Calendar Agent: "Search for any gym sessions in the user's calendar, focusing on recurring events and the next occurrence"

Calendar Agent (parses natural language): 
- Intent: { action: "search_events", eventTypes: ["gym"], focus: "recurring_events", timeRange: "next_occurrence" }
- Executes: searchEvents(["gym"], "recurring_events", "next_occurrence")

Calendar Agent → Master Agent: "Found gym sessions: Tuesday 6:30 PM, Thursday 7:00 AM, Saturday 10:00 AM. Next gym session is Tuesday at 6:30 PM."

Master Agent → User: "Your next gym session is Tuesday at 6:30 PM. You also have gym time scheduled for Thursday at 7:00 AM and Saturday at 10:00 AM this week."
```

### **Example: Complex Multi-Step Operation**

**Input**: "find a time for a 2-hour meeting with Sarah and Mike next week"

**Step 1: Intent Analysis**
```
"The user wants to schedule a 2-hour meeting with Sarah and Mike next week. This requires finding their contact information, checking everyone's availability, and suggesting optimal meeting times."
```

**Step 2: Plan Creation**
```
Plan:
1. Find contact information for Sarah and Mike
2. Check everyone's availability for next week
3. Suggest optimal 2-hour meeting times
```

**Step 3: Sequential Execution with Natural Language**
```
Step 1: Master Agent → Contact Agent: "Find contact information for Sarah and Mike"
Contact Agent (parses natural language):
- Intent: { action: "search", names: ["Sarah", "Mike"], context: "meeting" }
- Executes: searchContacts(["Sarah", "Mike"], "meeting")
Contact Agent → Master Agent: "Found Sarah: sarah@company.com, Mike: mike@company.com"

Step 2: Master Agent → Calendar Agent: "Check availability for sarah@company.com, mike@company.com, and the user for 2-hour meetings next week"
Calendar Agent (parses natural language):
- Intent: { action: "check_availability", attendees: [...], duration: "2 hours", timeRange: "next_week" }
- Executes: checkAvailability(attendees, "2 hours", "next_week")
Calendar Agent → Master Agent: "Found available time slots: Tuesday 2-4 PM, Wednesday 10 AM-12 PM, Thursday 3-5 PM"

Step 3: Master Agent → User: "I found several good options for your 2-hour meeting with Sarah and Mike next week. Here are the best times considering everyone's schedules: Tuesday 2-4 PM, Wednesday 10 AM-12 PM, or Thursday 3-5 PM. Would you like me to schedule one of these?"

Step 4: User → Master Agent: "Yes, schedule Tuesday 2-4 PM"
Master Agent → Calendar Agent: "Schedule a 2-hour meeting with sarah@company.com and mike@company.com for Tuesday 2-4 PM"
Calendar Agent (parses natural language):
- Intent: { action: "create_event", attendees: [...], time: "Tuesday 2-4 PM", duration: "2 hours" }
- Executes: createEvent(attendees, "Tuesday 2-4 PM", "2 hours")
- Confirmation Required: Yes (write operation)
Calendar Agent → Master Agent: "I'll schedule a 2-hour meeting with Sarah and Mike for Tuesday 2-4 PM. Confirm to proceed?"
```

## 🔄 **Dynamic Plan Modification - The Cursor-Like Magic**

This is what makes the system truly intelligent and Cursor-like. Plans don't just execute - they adapt based on what happens during execution.

### **Core Plan Modification Features**

#### **1. Add Steps Based on New Information**
```typescript
// Example: User adds more people to meeting
// Original plan: [Find Sarah, Find Mike, Check availability, Schedule]
// User: "Actually, include Lisa too"
// System: [Find Sarah, Find Mike, Find Lisa, Check availability for all, Schedule]
// ← Added step dynamically based on new information

class PlanModificationService {
  async addStepsToPlan(workflow: WorkflowState, newSteps: WorkflowStep[]): Promise<WorkflowState> {
    const updatedPlan = [...workflow.plan];
    const insertIndex = workflow.currentStep;
    
    // Insert new steps at current position
    newSteps.forEach((step, index) => {
      updatedPlan.splice(insertIndex + index, 0, {
        ...step,
        stepNumber: insertIndex + index + 1,
        status: 'pending'
      });
    });
    
    // Renumber subsequent steps
    for (let i = insertIndex + newSteps.length; i < updatedPlan.length; i++) {
      updatedPlan[i].stepNumber = i + 1;
    }
    
    return {
      ...workflow,
      plan: updatedPlan,
      totalSteps: updatedPlan.length
    };
  }
}
```

#### **2. Remove Unnecessary Steps**
```typescript
// Example: User already has contact info
// Original plan: [Find Sarah, Find Mike, Check availability, Schedule]
// Step 1 executes: "Found Sarah: sarah@company.com"
// Step 2 executes: "Found Mike: mike@company.com"
// System: "User already has contact info, skip contact lookup steps"
// New plan: [Check availability, Schedule]

async removeStepsFromPlan(workflow: WorkflowState, stepsToRemove: number[]): Promise<WorkflowState> {
  const updatedPlan = workflow.plan.filter(step => 
    !stepsToRemove.includes(step.stepNumber)
  );
  
  // Renumber steps
  updatedPlan.forEach((step, index) => {
    step.stepNumber = index + 1;
  });
  
  return {
    ...workflow,
    plan: updatedPlan,
    totalSteps: updatedPlan.length
  };
}
```

#### **3. Reorder Steps for Better Efficiency**
```typescript
// Example: Reorder steps to minimize API calls
// Original plan: [Find Sarah, Find Mike, Check Sarah availability, Check Mike availability, Schedule]
// System: "I can check availability for both at once"
// New plan: [Find Sarah, Find Mike, Check availability for both, Schedule]

async reorderSteps(workflow: WorkflowState, newOrder: number[]): Promise<WorkflowState> {
  const reorderedPlan = newOrder.map(stepNumber => 
    workflow.plan.find(step => step.stepNumber === stepNumber)
  ).filter(Boolean) as WorkflowStep[];
  
  // Renumber steps
  reorderedPlan.forEach((step, index) => {
    step.stepNumber = index + 1;
  });
  
  return {
    ...workflow,
    plan: reorderedPlan
  };
}
```

#### **4. Skip Failed Steps and Continue**
```typescript
// Example: Contact not found
// Original plan: [Find Sarah, Find Mike, Check availability, Schedule]
// Step 1: Find Sarah ✅
// Step 2: Find Mike ❌ (Mike not found)
// System: "Skip step 2, continue with step 3"
// New plan: [Find Sarah ✅, Find Mike ❌ (skipped), Check availability, Schedule]

async skipFailedStep(workflow: WorkflowState, stepNumber: number): Promise<WorkflowState> {
  const updatedPlan = workflow.plan.map(step => 
    step.stepNumber === stepNumber 
      ? { ...step, status: 'skipped' }
      : step
  );
  
  return {
    ...workflow,
    plan: updatedPlan,
    currentStep: stepNumber + 1
  };
}
```

#### **5. Skip Failed Steps and Continue**
```typescript
// Example: Contact not found
// Original plan: [Find Sarah, Find Mike, Check availability, Schedule]
// Step 1: Find Sarah ✅
// Step 2: Find Mike ❌ (Mike not found)
// System: "Skip step 2, continue with step 3"
// New plan: [Find Sarah ✅, Find Mike ❌ (skipped), Check availability, Schedule]

async skipFailedStep(workflow: WorkflowState, stepNumber: number): Promise<WorkflowState> {
  const updatedPlan = workflow.plan.map(step => 
    step.stepNumber === stepNumber 
      ? { ...step, status: 'skipped' }
      : step
  );
  
  return {
    ...workflow,
    plan: updatedPlan,
    currentStep: stepNumber + 1
  };
}
```

### **Real-World Examples**

#### **Example 1: Adding Steps Dynamically**
```typescript
// User: "Send emails to john, sarah, mike"
// System: Creates plan with 3 steps
// User: "Actually, include lisa too"

// System dynamically adds step:
const newStep = {
  stepId: 'step_4',
  stepNumber: 4,
  description: 'Send email to lisa@company.com',
  toolCall: { name: 'emailAgent', parameters: { recipient: 'lisa@company.com' } },
  status: 'pending'
};

// Plan becomes:
// 1. Prepare email template
// 2. Send email to john@company.com  
// 3. Send email to sarah@company.com
// 4. Send email to mike@company.com
// 5. Send email to lisa@company.com  ← Added dynamically
// 6. Generate summary report
```

#### **Example 2: Removing Unnecessary Steps**
```typescript
// User: "Schedule meeting with Sarah and Mike"
// System: Creates plan:
// 1. Find Sarah's contact info
// 2. Find Mike's contact info  
// 3. Check availability
// 4. Schedule meeting

// Step 1 executes: "Found Sarah: sarah@company.com"
// Step 2 executes: "Found Mike: mike@company.com" 
// Step 3 executes: "Mike is not available next week"

// System dynamically modifies plan:
// 1. Find Sarah's contact info ✅
// 2. Find Mike's contact info ✅
// 3. Check availability ✅
// 4. Suggest alternative times ← Modified step
// 5. Schedule meeting ← Moved to end
```

#### **Example 3: Skipping Failed Steps**
```typescript
// User: "Schedule meeting with Sarah and Mike"
// System: Creates plan:
// 1. Find Sarah's contact info
// 2. Find Mike's contact info  
// 3. Check availability
// 4. Schedule meeting

// Step 1 executes: "Found Sarah: sarah@company.com"
// Step 2 executes: "Mike not found in contacts"
// System: "Skip step 2, continue with step 3"

// Plan becomes:
// 1. Find Sarah's contact info ✅
// 2. Find Mike's contact info ❌ (skipped)
// 3. Check availability for Sarah only
// 4. Schedule meeting with Sarah
```

### **Why This Makes It Cursor-Like**

Just like Cursor analyzes code and adapts its approach based on what it finds, this system:

1. **Analyzes** what happens during execution
2. **Adapts** the plan based on new information
3. **Continues** with the modified plan
4. **Learns** from what works and what doesn't

This creates a truly intelligent system that feels like working with a smart assistant who can think and adapt, not just follow rigid instructions.

## 🔧 **Integration with Existing Systems**

The enhanced system needs to integrate seamlessly with your existing sophisticated infrastructure. Here's how the workflow system will interact with current systems:

- **User Experience**: Enhanced experience, no breaking changes

## 🗄️ **Basic Workflow State Management**

### **Cache-Based State Management**

The system uses Redis cache for all workflow state management, providing fast access and automatic cleanup:

```typescript
interface WorkflowState {
  workflowId: string;
  sessionId: string;
  userId: string;
  status: 'active' | 'paused' | 'completed' | 'cancelled';
  currentStep: number;
  totalSteps: number;
  plan: WorkflowStep[];
  completedSteps: WorkflowStep[];
  pendingStep: WorkflowStep | null;
  context: {
    originalRequest: string;
    userIntent: string;
    gatheredData: Record<string, any>;
  };
  createdAt: Date;
  lastActivity: Date;
  expiresAt: Date;
}

interface WorkflowStep {
  stepId: string;
  stepNumber: number;
  description: string;
  toolCall: ToolCall;
  status: 'pending' | 'awaiting_confirmation' | 'confirmed' | 'executed' | 'failed' | 'skipped';
  result?: ToolResult;
  confirmationData?: ConfirmationData;
  retryCount: number;
  maxRetries: number;
}
```

### **Cache Key Strategy**

```typescript
// Workflow state keys
const WORKFLOW_KEYS = {
  active: `workflow:active:${workflowId}`,
  steps: `workflow:steps:${workflowId}`,
  context: `workflow:context:${workflowId}`,
  progress: `workflow:progress:${workflowId}`
};

// Session-based keys for quick lookup
const SESSION_KEYS = {
  activeWorkflows: `session:${sessionId}:active_workflows`,
  pendingConfirmations: `session:${sessionId}:pending_confirmations`,
  messageQueue: `session:${sessionId}:message_queue`
};

// TTL Strategy
const TTL_STRATEGY = {
  activeWorkflow: 3600,        // 1 hour - active workflows
  completedWorkflow: 86400,   // 24 hours - completed workflows  
  pendingConfirmation: 1800,  // 30 minutes - pending confirmations
  messageQueue: 7200,         // 2 hours - queued messages
  sessionContext: 1800        // 30 minutes - session context
};
```

### **Workflow Execution Flow**

```typescript
// Step 1: Create Workflow
const workflow = await workflowManager.createWorkflow({
  originalRequest: "Send this email template to john@company.com, sarah@company.com, mike@company.com",
  plan: [
    { stepNumber: 1, description: "Prepare email template", toolCall: {...} },
    { stepNumber: 2, description: "Send email to john@company.com", toolCall: {...} },
    { stepNumber: 3, description: "Send email to sarah@company.com", toolCall: {...} },
    { stepNumber: 4, description: "Send email to mike@company.com", toolCall: {...} },
    { stepNumber: 5, description: "Generate summary report", toolCall: {...} }
  ]
});

// Step 2: Execute Step 1 (no confirmation needed)
await workflowManager.executeStep(workflow.workflowId, 1);

// Step 3: Execute Step 2 (confirmation needed)
await workflowManager.executeStep(workflow.workflowId, 2);
// System: "I'll send the email template to john@company.com. Confirm to proceed?"
// User: "yes" → Step 2 executed
// User: "no" → Step 2 skipped, move to Step 3
// User: "what about sarah?" → Handle interruption (see below)
```

### **Pure LLM-Driven Context Analysis**

The system uses AI to intelligently analyze user intent and determine how to handle interruptions, with no string matching or rigid rules.

#### **Context Analysis System**
```typescript
interface ContextAnalysis {
  isRelatedToCurrentWorkflow: boolean;
  confidence: number; // 0-1
  suggestedAction: 'continue' | 'pause' | 'clear' | 'ask_user';
  reasoning: string;
  userIntent: string;
  workflowImpact: 'none' | 'minor' | 'major' | 'complete_replacement';
}

class ContextAnalysisService extends BaseService {
  async analyzeUserIntent(
    userInput: string, 
    currentWorkflow: WorkflowState
  ): Promise<ContextAnalysis> {
    
    const analysisPrompt = `
You are an AI context analyzer. Analyze the relationship between a user's new input and their current workflow.

CURRENT WORKFLOW CONTEXT:
- Original Request: "${currentWorkflow.context.originalRequest}"
- Current Step: "${currentWorkflow.pendingStep?.description}"
- Progress: Step ${currentWorkflow.currentStep} of ${currentWorkflow.totalSteps}
- Status: ${currentWorkflow.status}

USER'S NEW INPUT:
"${userInput}"

ANALYSIS TASK:
Determine if the user's new input is related to their current workflow or if they're starting something new.

RESPONSE FORMAT (JSON only):
{
  "isRelatedToCurrentWorkflow": boolean,
  "confidence": number (0-1),
  "suggestedAction": "continue" | "pause" | "clear" | "ask_user",
  "reasoning": "brief explanation of your analysis",
  "userIntent": "what the user actually wants to accomplish",
  "workflowImpact": "none" | "minor" | "major" | "complete_replacement"
}

GUIDELINES:
- "continue": User is asking about or modifying the current workflow
- "pause": User has a quick unrelated question but will likely return to workflow
- "clear": User is clearly starting a completely new task/workflow
- "ask_user": Ambiguous case - need user clarification
`;

    const response = await this.openaiService.generateText(
      analysisPrompt,
      'You are a context analysis expert. Return only valid JSON.',
      { temperature: 0.1, maxTokens: 500 }
    );
    
    return JSON.parse(response);
  }
}
```

#### **Intelligent Response Generation**
```typescript
class IntelligentResponseService extends BaseService {
  async handleUserInput(
    userInput: string, 
    sessionId: string, 
    userId?: string
  ): Promise<Response> {
    
    // Get current workflow
    const activeWorkflows = await this.workflowCacheService.getActiveWorkflows(sessionId);
    const currentWorkflow = activeWorkflows[0];
    
    if (!currentWorkflow) {
      // No active workflow - process as new request
      return await this.masterAgent.processUserInput(userInput, sessionId, userId);
    }
    
    // Analyze context relationship using LLM
    const contextAnalysis = await this.contextAnalysisService.analyzeUserIntent(
      userInput, 
      currentWorkflow
    );
    
    // Generate appropriate response based on analysis
    return await this.generateContextualResponse(
      userInput, 
      currentWorkflow, 
      contextAnalysis, 
      sessionId, 
      userId
    );
  }
}
```

#### **Context-Aware Response Examples**

**Scenario 1: Continue Workflow**
```typescript
// User: "Send emails to john, sarah, mike"
// System: "Confirm to proceed?"
// User: "Can you add mike@company.com to the email list?"

// LLM Analysis: { action: 'continue', confidence: 0.95 }
// System: "I'll add mike@company.com to the email list. The updated list now includes john@company.com, sarah@company.com, and mike@company.com. Confirm to send?"
```

**Scenario 2: Pause Workflow**
```typescript
// User: "Send emails to john, sarah, mike"
// System: "Confirm to proceed?"
// User: "What time is it?"

// LLM Analysis: { action: 'pause', confidence: 0.9 }
// System: "It's 2:30 PM. By the way, I was ready to send those emails to john@company.com, sarah@company.com, and mike@company.com. Should I continue with that?"
```

**Scenario 3: Clear Workflow**
```typescript
// User: "Send emails to john, sarah, mike"
// System: "Confirm to proceed?"
// User: "Actually, let me schedule a meeting with the team instead"

// LLM Analysis: { action: 'clear', confidence: 0.95 }
// System: "I'll help you schedule a meeting with the team instead. Let me find available times..."
```

**Scenario 4: Ask User**
```typescript
// User: "Send emails to john, sarah, mike"
// System: "Confirm to proceed?"
// User: "I need to check something first"

// LLM Analysis: { action: 'ask_user', confidence: 0.3 }
// System: "I was ready to send those emails. Would you like me to wait while you check something, or should I help you with something else instead?"
```

### **Handling Messages During Active Tasks**

#### **Scenario: New Message While Processing**
```typescript
interface TaskState {
  taskId: string;
  sessionId: string;
  status: 'processing' | 'awaiting_confirmation' | 'paused' | 'completed';
  currentOperation: string;
  progress: {
    currentStep: number;
    totalSteps: number;
    description: string;
  };
  context: {
    originalRequest: string;
    userIntent: string;
    gatheredData: Record<string, any>;
  };
  createdAt: Date;
  lastActivity: Date;
}

// When new message arrives during active task
async handleNewMessageDuringTask(taskId: string, newMessage: string): Promise<MessageResponse> {
  const currentTask = await taskManager.getTask(taskId);
  
  if (currentTask.status === 'processing') {
    // Task is actively running - queue the message
    await messageQueue.addMessage({
      taskId,
      message: newMessage,
      priority: 'normal',
      queuedAt: new Date()
    });
    
    return {
      response: "I'm currently working on your request. I'll get back to you as soon as I'm done.",
      taskStatus: {
        currentOperation: currentTask.currentOperation,
        progress: currentTask.progress,
        estimatedCompletion: "2-3 minutes"
      }
    };
  }
  
  if (currentTask.status === 'awaiting_confirmation') {
    // Task is waiting for confirmation - handle interruption
    await taskManager.pauseTask(taskId);
    const newResponse = await masterAgent.processUserInput(newMessage, sessionId, userId);
    
    return {
      response: newResponse,
      taskReminder: {
        taskId,
        pausedAt: currentTask.currentOperation,
        originalRequest: currentTask.context.originalRequest,
        canResume: true
      }
    };
  }
}
```

### **Cache Implementation**

```typescript
export class WorkflowCacheService extends BaseService {
  private cacheService: CacheService;
  
  constructor() {
    super('workflowCacheService');
    this.cacheService = serviceManager.getService('cacheService');
  }
  
  // Create workflow in cache
  async createWorkflow(workflow: WorkflowState): Promise<void> {
    const key = `workflow:${workflow.workflowId}`;
    await this.cacheService.set(key, workflow, TTL_STRATEGY.activeWorkflow);
    
    // Add to session's active workflows list
    await this.addToSessionActiveWorkflows(workflow.sessionId, workflow.workflowId);
  }
  
  // Get workflow with fallback
  async getWorkflow(workflowId: string): Promise<WorkflowState | null> {
    const key = `workflow:${workflowId}`;
    return await this.cacheService.get(key);
  }
  
  // Update workflow state
  async updateWorkflow(workflowId: string, updates: Partial<WorkflowState>): Promise<void> {
    const workflow = await this.getWorkflow(workflowId);
    if (!workflow) return;
    
    const updatedWorkflow = { 
      ...workflow, 
      ...updates, 
      lastActivity: new Date() 
    };
    
    const key = `workflow:${workflowId}`;
    await this.cacheService.set(key, updatedWorkflow, TTL_STRATEGY.activeWorkflow);
  }
  
  // Get all active workflows for a session
  async getActiveWorkflows(sessionId: string): Promise<WorkflowState[]> {
    const activeWorkflowIds = await this.cacheService.get<string[]>(
      `session:${sessionId}:active_workflows`
    ) || [];
    
    const workflows: WorkflowState[] = [];
    for (const workflowId of activeWorkflowIds) {
      const workflow = await this.getWorkflow(workflowId);
      if (workflow && workflow.status === 'active') {
        workflows.push(workflow);
      }
    }
    
    return workflows;
  }
  
  // Handle workflow completion
  async completeWorkflow(workflowId: string): Promise<void> {
    const workflow = await this.getWorkflow(workflowId);
    if (!workflow) return;
    
    // Update status
    await this.updateWorkflow(workflowId, { 
      status: 'completed',
      completedAt: new Date()
    });
    
    // Remove from active workflows
    await this.removeFromSessionActiveWorkflows(workflow.sessionId, workflowId);
    
    // Set longer TTL for completed workflow (for potential resume)
    const key = `workflow:${workflowId}`;
    await this.cacheService.set(key, workflow, TTL_STRATEGY.completedWorkflow);
  }
}
```

### **Benefits of Cache-Based Approach**

1. **Performance**: 10ms response time vs 50-100ms for database
2. **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling with Redis clustering
3. **Automatic Cleanup**: TTL expiration handles cleanup
4. **Integration**: Leverages existing Redis infrastructure
5. **Reliability**: Graceful degradation when Redis unavailable

## 🔄 **Integration with Existing Confirmation System**

The Cursor-like approach enhances your existing confirmation system, which already correctly handles write vs read operations:

### **✅ Current Confirmation System (Already Perfect)**

Your system already uses AI-powered operation detection to determine confirmation requirements:

```typescript
// AI Classification Service determines confirmation needs
async operationRequiresConfirmation(operation: string, agentName: string): Promise<boolean> {
  const response = await this.openaiService.generateText(
    `Determine if this operation requires user confirmation for ${agentName}: "${operation}"
    
    Return exactly: yes or no
    
    Examples:
    - "send email" → yes (write operation)
    - "create calendar event" → yes (write operation)
    - "read inbox" → no (read operation)
    - "search contacts" → no (read operation)
    - "delete contact" → yes (destructive operation)
    - "list emails" → no (read operation)`,
    'Determine if operations require confirmation. Return only: yes or no',
    { temperature: 0, maxTokens: 5 }
  );
  return response.trim().toLowerCase() === 'yes';
}
```

### **Enhanced Confirmation Flow**
```
User Input → Intent Analysis → Plan Creation → AI Confirmation Check → Preview Mode (if needed) → Confirmation (if needed) → Sequential Execution → Reevaluation → Response
```

### **How Enhanced Design Works with Confirmation System**

#### **1. Natural Language Operations with AI Confirmation Detection**
```typescript
// Master Agent creates natural language tool call
const toolCall = {
  name: "calendarAgent",
  parameters: {
    query: "Search for any gym sessions in the user's calendar, focusing on recurring events and the next occurrence"
  }
};

// AI Classification Service determines if this needs confirmation
const needsConfirmation = await aiClassificationService.operationRequiresConfirmation(
  "Search for any gym sessions in the user's calendar, focusing on recurring events and the next occurrence",
  "calendarAgent"
);
// Result: false (read operation) - No confirmation needed
```

#### **2. Write Operations Still Get Confirmation**
```typescript
// Master Agent creates natural language tool call for write operation
const toolCall = {
  name: "emailAgent",
  parameters: {
    query: "Send project update email to john@company.com, sarah@company.com, and mike@company.com"
  }
};

// AI Classification Service determines if this needs confirmation
const needsConfirmation = await aiClassificationService.operationRequiresConfirmation(
  "Send project update email to john@company.com, sarah@company.com, and mike@company.com",
  "emailAgent"
);
// Result: true (write operation) - Confirmation required
```

### **Confirmation Logic**

The enhanced system maintains the existing confirmation logic: **only write operations need confirmation**.

#### **Read Operations (No Confirmation)**
```typescript
// Finding contact info - READ operation
"Find Sarah and Mike's contact information"
→ "I found Sarah: sarah@company.com, Mike: mike@company.com"

// Checking availability - READ operation  
"Check everyone's availability for next week"
→ "Found available time slots: Tuesday 2-4 PM, Wednesday 10 AM-12 PM"

// Suggesting meeting times - READ operation
"Suggest the best 2-hour meeting times"
→ "I recommend Tuesday 2-4 PM or Wednesday 10 AM-12 PM based on everyone's schedules"
```

#### **Write Operations (Confirmation Required)**
```typescript
// Actually scheduling the meeting - WRITE operation
"Schedule the meeting for Tuesday 2-4 PM"
→ "I'll schedule a 2-hour meeting with Sarah and Mike for Tuesday 2-4 PM. Confirm to proceed?"

// Sending emails - WRITE operation
"Send email to john@company.com"
→ "I'll send an email to john@company.com about the project update. Confirm to send?"
```

### **Confirmation System Enhancements**

#### **1. Plan-Aware Previews**
- **Current**: "Schedule meeting with Sarah and Mike"
- **Enhanced**: "I'll find Sarah and Mike's contact info, check everyone's availability for next week, and suggest the best 2-hour meeting times."
- **After Analysis**: "I found these available times: Tuesday 2-4 PM, Wednesday 10 AM-12 PM. Would you like me to schedule one of these?"

#### **2. Step-by-Step Confirmations**
- **Current**: Single confirmation for entire operation
- **Enhanced**: Option to confirm each step or the entire plan

#### **3. Context-Aware Confirmation Messages**
- **Current**: "Send email to john@example.com. Confirm?"
- **Enhanced**: "I'll send an email to john@company.com about the project update we discussed in Slack yesterday. The email will include the meeting notes and ask for feedback by Friday. Confirm to send?"

#### **4. Read-Only Agent Check**
```typescript
// From agent-config.ts
operationRequiresConfirmation: async (agentName: keyof typeof AGENT_CONFIG, operation: string): Promise<boolean> => {
  const agent = AGENT_CONFIG[agentName];
  
  // If agent is read-only, no confirmation needed
  if (agent.isReadOnly) {
    return false;
  }
  
  // Use AI to determine if operation is read-only
  const detectedOperation = await aiClassificationService.detectOperation(operation, agentName);
  
  if (detectedOperation === 'read' || detectedOperation === 'search' || detectedOperation === 'list') {
    return false;
  }
  
  return true; // Assume write operations need confirmation
}
```

### **Key Benefits of Integration**

1. **Preserves Your Confirmation Logic**: Read operations get no confirmation, write operations require confirmation
2. **AI-Powered Detection**: Handles natural language operations intelligently
3. **Enhanced User Experience**: Better confirmation messages using natural language
4. **Maintains Security**: All write operations still require confirmation
5. **No Changes Needed**: Your existing confirmation system works perfectly with the enhanced design

## 📊 **Bulk Operations Support**

### **Bulk Operations as Multi-Step Processes**
Bulk operations are just multi-step processes that the standard flow handles naturally:

```typescript
// Input: "Send this project update email to john@company.com, sarah@company.com, mike@company.com, and lisa@company.com"
// Intent Analysis: "The user wants to send a project update email to multiple recipients. This requires sending the same email template to 4 different people efficiently."

// Plan Creation:
// 1. Prepare email template
// 2. Send email to john@company.com
// 3. Send email to sarah@company.com  
// 4. Send email to mike@company.com
// 5. Send email to lisa@company.com
// 6. Generate summary report

// Sequential Execution with Natural Language:
// Step 1: Master Agent → Email Agent: "Prepare email template for project update"
// Email Agent (parses natural language): { action: "prepare_template", type: "project_update" }
// Step 2: Master Agent → Email Agent: "Send project update email to john@company.com"
// Email Agent (parses natural language): { action: "send_email", recipient: "john@company.com", template: "project_update" }
// Step 3: Master Agent → Email Agent: "Send project update email to sarah@company.com"
// ... and so on
```

### **Why This Approach is Better**
1. **Unified Flow**: Everything uses the same sequential planning and execution
2. **Natural Handling**: Bulk operations are just longer plans with more steps
3. **Better Error Recovery**: Can handle partial failures gracefully
4. **Flexible Adaptation**: Can modify the plan based on what happens during execution
5. **Consistent User Experience**: Same confirmation and response patterns
