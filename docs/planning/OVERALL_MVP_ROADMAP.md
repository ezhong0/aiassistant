const contextDetection = await aiClassificationService.detectContextNeeds(userInput, slackContext);

// After: Cache-first approach
const contextDetection = await aiClassificationService.detectContextNeeds(userInput, slackContext);
// ‚Üë Now checks cache first, only calls OpenAI if needed

// Expected Results:
// - Hit Rate: 60-80%
// - Cost Savings: $5-16/day ‚Üí $1-3/day
// - Speed Improvement: 1-3 seconds per request
```

const contact = await contactService.resolveContact("John");

// After: Cache-first approach
const contact = await contactService.resolveContact("John");
// ‚Üë Now checks cache first, only calls API if needed

// Expected Results:
// - Hit Rate: 80-95%
// - Speed Improvement: 200-500ms per lookup
// - Cost Savings: Fewer Google Contacts API calls
```

### **Phase 2: External API Optimization (Week 2)**

// ‚Üë Now checks cache first, only calls Slack API if needed

// Expected Results:
// - Hit Rate: 70-90%
// - Speed Improvement: 500ms-2s per request
// - Rate Limit Protection: Fewer Slack API calls
```

#### **Email Search Cache Implementation**
```typescript
// Current: Direct Gmail API calls
const emails = await emailAgent.handleSearchEmails(params, actionParams);

// After: Cache-first approach
const emails = await emailAgent.handleSearchEmails(params, actionParams);
// ‚Üë Now checks cache first, only calls Gmail API if needed

// Expected Results:
