# Executive Assistant AI System Design

## System Overview

An intelligent executive assistant system architected on Claude Code's principles of specialized agents, deep context awareness, and intelligent orchestration. The system uses a Master Orchestrator Agent that delegates complex workflows to domain-specialized agents through natural language conversation, creating a powerful yet elegant multi-agent coordination framework.

## MVP Scope and Constraints

- Natural-language messaging between agents; no bespoke protocol layer. Use simple structured NL messages with minimal envelope (ids/correlation/timeouts) as needed.
- Planning is linear (or simple single-branch) for MVP; avoid complex graphs.
- Email Agent (MVP): draft/send emails, basic thread/label fetch, single follow-up sequence to non-responders.
- Calendar Agent (MVP): primary calendar free/busy, event create/update, simple room selection via static tag/list.
- Context (MVP): metadata-only bootstrap for recent email threads and calendar events; manual preferences for tone/working hours/VIPs; no signature scraping.
- Execution: TodoWrite workflow tracking with linear dependencies, previews and approvals for medium/high-risk actions, durable persistence.
- Defer to later phases: full Gmail/Calendar coverage, multi-calendar optimization, advanced analytics/segmentation, influence mapping, proactive suggestions, complex negotiation loops.

## Core Architecture Philosophy

**Agent-Based Design**: Following Claude Code's sub-agent model, the system is built around specialized domain agents that communicate through natural language conversation.

**Conversational Coordination**: Agents coordinate through structured conversation rather than rigid APIs, enabling flexible and adaptive workflow execution.

**Context-Driven Intelligence**: Rich, multi-layered context drives all decisions, from simple email composition to complex workflow optimization.

**Learning-Enabled**: The system continuously learns from user interactions, outcomes, and patterns to improve suggestions and automation.

**Safety-First Execution**: All significant actions require explicit or implicit user confirmation with clear preview and rollback capabilities.

- Domain identification for appropriate agent delegation
- Cross-domain dependency analysis
- Risk and safety assessment
- Resource and timeline estimation

**Conversational Delegation:**
- Natural language task assignment to domain agents
- Context sharing through structured conversation

### Workflow State Management (TodoWrite System)
**Multi-Step Process Tracking:**
- Each complex workflow broken into atomic tasks with clear states
- State tracking: pending → in_progress → completed → failed
- Linear dependency management between tasks across agents for MVP
- Progress visibility for user with ability to modify in-flight workflows

**Workflow State Engine:**
- **Workflow Creation**: Master Agent decomposes complex requests into tracked tasks
- **State Persistence**: All workflow states maintained across system restarts
- **Progress Monitoring**: Real-time updates as agents complete individual tasks
- **Dependency Resolution**: Automatic task progression when dependencies are met
- **Interruption Handling**: User can pause, modify, or cancel workflows at any point

**Example Workflow State:**
```
Workflow: "Set up board meeting next month"
Task 1: [completed] "Find optimal meeting time for 8 executives"
Task 2: [completed] "Book Conference Room A with AV setup"
Task 3: [in_progress] "Send formal invitations to board members"
Task 4: [pending] "Set up agenda collection deadline"
Task 5: [pending] "Configure RSVP tracking and follow-ups"
```

**State Synchronization:**
- Agents update task states through conversational status reports
- Master Agent maintains authoritative workflow state
- User can query workflow status or modify remaining tasks
- Failed tasks trigger alternative approaches or user notification

### Safety and Validation Framework
**Conversational Safety:**
- Agent-level risk assessment through dialogue
- Cross-agent validation for complex workflows
- User confirmation through natural conversation
- Clear explanation of planned actions and impacts

**Confirmation Protocols:**
- **Implicit Confirmation**: Low-risk, routine tasks proceed automatically
- **Conversational Preview**: Medium-risk actions explained before execution
- **Explicit Approval**: High-risk workflows require detailed user confirmation
- **Workflow Preview**: Complex multi-step workflows shown before execution

**Safety Mechanisms:**
- Agent-level rollback capabilities
- Workflow checkpoint system for user intervention
- Real-time monitoring through agent status updates
- Complete audit trail of all agent conversations and actions

## Operational Flows and Error Handling

### Standard Workflow Execution Flow
**Single-Agent Tasks:**
```
1. User Request → Master Agent parses intent
2. Master Agent identifies required domain agent
3. Master Agent delegates with context via conversation
4. Domain Agent executes and reports status
5. Master Agent confirms completion with user
```

**Multi-Agent Workflows:**
```
1. User Request → Master Agent decomposes into workflow with tasks
2. Master Agent creates TodoWrite workflow with dependencies
3. Master Agent delegates first task(s) to appropriate agents
4. Agents execute, report completion, update workflow state
5. Master Agent progresses workflow based on dependencies
6. Process continues until all tasks completed
7. Master Agent reports final workflow completion
```

### Error Handling and Recovery
**API Failure Handling:**
- **Transient Failures**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- **Service Outages**: Agent reports capability loss, suggests alternatives
- **Authentication Issues**: Agent requests credential refresh, notifies user
- **Rate Limiting**: Agent queues operations, provides status updates

**Workflow Error Recovery:**
```
Error Scenario: Calendar Agent cannot book requested room
1. Calendar Agent reports: "Conference Room A unavailable for March 15"
2. Master Agent evaluates alternatives: "Room B available, or reschedule to March 16"
3. Master Agent asks user: "Room A unavailable. Use Room B or reschedule?"
4. User responds, Master Agent updates workflow, delegates new task
5. Calendar Agent executes alternative, workflow continues
```

**Agent Communication Failures:**
- **Agent Unresponsive**: Master Agent timeout, switch to alternative approach
- **Malformed Responses**: Master Agent requests clarification from agent
- **Context Loss**: Master Agent re-provides context, resumes workflow
- **State Desynchronization**: Master Agent queries agent state, reconciles differences

### Confirmation and Safety Protocols
**Risk Assessment Levels:**
- **Low Risk**: Routine calendar blocks, standard email responses → Automatic execution
- **Medium Risk**: Meeting rescheduling, non-standard emails → Preview and confirm
- **High Risk**: Mass communications, important meeting changes → Explicit approval required

**Confirmation Flow Example:**
```
High-Risk Action: Reschedule board meeting
1. Calendar Agent identifies need to reschedule board meeting
2. Calendar Agent reports to Master Agent with impact analysis
3. Master Agent presents to user: "Board meeting conflict detected. Proposed reschedule affects 8 executives. Approve change to March 16?"
4. User approves, Master Agent delegates rescheduling tasks
5. Email Agent drafts notification, shows preview to user
6. User approves, agents execute coordinated rescheduling
```

### Context Validation and Learning
**Context Accuracy Checking:**
- **Relationship Validation**: Periodically verify learned relationship strengths against recent interactions
- **Pattern Verification**: Test learned patterns against new data, adjust confidence scores
- **Preference Validation**: Occasionally confirm learned preferences with user
- **Context Expiry**: Mark old context as less reliable, prioritize recent patterns

**Learning Feedback Loops:**
```
Learning Cycle:
1. Agent executes task (e.g., sends email)
2. System tracks outcome (response rate, timing, user satisfaction)
3. Pattern recognition analyzes success factors
4. Adjusts future decision-making based on learned patterns
5. User feedback further refines learning
```

## Agent Coordination Infrastructure

### Inter-Agent Communication Protocol
**Structured Conversation Format:**
- **Status Reports**: Agents report task completion, failures, and progress
- **Context Requests**: Agents request additional context for task execution
- **Capability Queries**: Agents check what other agents can do
- **Handoff Protocols**: Agents transfer context when delegating sub-tasks

**Message Structure:**
```
Agent: Email Agent
Status: Task Complete
Task: "Send board meeting invitations"
Result: "8 invitations sent successfully, RSVP tracking enabled"
Context Updates: "Board member Sarah prefers morning meetings (learned from response)"
Next Actions: "Monitor RSVPs, follow up in 48 hours if low response rate"
```

### Shared State Management
**Workflow State Synchronization:**
- Master Agent maintains authoritative workflow state
- All agents can query current workflow status
- Agents update task states through conversational status reports
- State changes trigger dependent task availability

**Context Sharing:**
- All agents access shared entity graph for relationship context
- Context updates from one agent benefit all other agents
- Privacy boundaries prevent inappropriate context sharing
- Context versioning tracks changes over time

### System Health and Monitoring
**Agent Health Monitoring:**
- Each agent reports health status and capability availability
- Master Agent tracks agent response times and success rates
- Automatic fallback when agents become unavailable
- Performance optimization based on agent efficiency metrics

**System Recovery:**
- Workflow state persistence survives system restarts
- Context recovery from last known good state
- Agent restart procedures restore capability without data loss
- User notification of any service interruptions or limitations

## Natural Language Understanding

### Intent Architecture
**Multi-Level Intent Decomposition:**
- **Primary Intent**: Core user goal (e.g., "coordinate meeting")
- **Sub-Intents**: Component tasks (scheduling, invitations, follow-ups)
- **Constraints**: Explicit and implicit limitations (time, attendees, format)
- **Context Requirements**: Information needed for optimal execution

**Intent Categories:**
```
Workflow Intents:
├── Communication Orchestration (email campaigns, sequences, responses)
├── Schedule Coordination (meetings, optimization, logistics)
├── Relationship Management (context-aware interactions, follow-ups)
├── Information Processing (triage, analysis, routing)
├── Proactive Optimization (suggestions, pattern recognition)
└── Learning and Adaptation (preference updates, pattern refinement)
```

**Conversational Processing Example:**
```
"Coordinate the customer visit: schedule meetings, book conference rooms, send logistics email to attendees" →

Master Agent Analysis:
├── Intent: Multi-step coordination workflow
├── Context: Customer visit (extract from entity graph)
├── Required Agents: Calendar Agent + Email Agent
├── Dependencies: Room availability → Meeting scheduling → Communication
└── Delegation Strategy: Sequential agent conversation with coordination

Agent Conversation Flow:
Master → Calendar Agent: "Schedule customer visit meetings and book conference rooms"
Calendar Agent → Master: "Meetings scheduled, Room B reserved for March 10"
Master → Email Agent: "Send logistics details for customer visit on March 10"
Email Agent → Master: "Logistics email sent to 12 attendees with room details"
```

### Context-Driven Communication
**Relationship Intelligence:**
- Dynamic communication style based on relationship strength and context
- Historical interaction pattern analysis for tone optimization
- Stakeholder influence mapping for appropriate formality levels
- Cultural and temporal context considerations

## Workflow Examples

### Complex Meeting Coordination
```
User: "Set up the board meeting next month - send calendar invites, request agenda items, and follow up on RSVPs"

**Master Agent Analysis:**
├── Intent: Multi-step coordination workflow
├── Context: Board meeting (high-stakes, formal, quarterly pattern)
├── Stakeholders: Board members (from shared entity graph)
├── Constraints: Executive schedules, formal venue requirements
└── Delegation Strategy: Calendar Agent → Email Agent → Coordination

**Agent Delegation Flow:**

Master Agent → Calendar Agent:
"Schedule quarterly board meeting for next month. High-priority executives, formal venue with AV, 2-hour duration."

Calendar Agent Processing:
- Analyzes 8 executive calendars with timezone considerations
- Identifies optimal slot: March 15, 2-4pm EST
- Books Conference Room A with AV setup and dial-in capabilities
- Blocks preparation time for organizer

Calendar Agent → Master Agent:
"Board meeting scheduled March 15, 2-4pm EST, Conference Room A with AV. All attendees available. Prep time blocked."

Master Agent → Email Agent:
"Send formal board meeting invitations for March 15 meeting. Include agenda request deadline and RSVP tracking."

Email Agent Processing:
- Composes formal invitations with board-appropriate tone
- Includes meeting logistics and agenda submission deadline
- Sets up RSVP tracking and follow-up sequences
- Personalizes based on individual board member preferences

Email Agent → Master Agent:
"Formal invitations sent to 8 board members. Agenda deadline set for March 8. RSVP tracking active with follow-up sequence scheduled."
```

### Email Campaign with Learning
Note: For MVP, simplify to a single follow-up; advanced segmentation/analytics deferred.
```
User: "Launch the customer satisfaction survey: send initial email, follow up with non-responders in 1 week"

**Master Agent Analysis:**
├── Intent: Sequence-based communication campaign
├── Context: Customer satisfaction (relationship maintenance, feedback collection)
├── Recipients: Customer database (segment by relationship strength and engagement)
├── Learning: Previous survey patterns (response rates, timing optimization)
└── Strategy: Personalized approach with intelligent follow-up sequences

**Agent Delegation Flow:**

Master Agent → Email Agent:
"Launch customer satisfaction survey campaign. Segment by relationship strength, personalize messaging, track engagement, follow up with non-responders in 1 week."

Email Agent Processing:
- Analyzes customer database: 347 customers across 3 engagement tiers
- Applies learned patterns: Tuesday 10am optimal for surveys
- Composes 3 message variants based on relationship strength
- Sets up response tracking and analytics
- Schedules follow-up sequence with different messaging

Email Agent → Master Agent:
"Survey campaign launched to 347 customers in 3 segments. Sent 142 high-engagement, 128 medium-engagement, 77 new-customer variants. Response tracking active. Follow-up sequence scheduled for March 8."

Master Agent Follow-up (1 week later):
"Email Agent, execute follow-up sequence for survey non-responders with gentler tone and different value proposition."

Email Agent → Master Agent:
"Follow-up sent to 89 non-responders with 'quick feedback' approach. Total campaign response rate: 34% (above 28% historical average). Insights captured for future optimization."
```

### Proactive Calendar Optimization
Note: Deferred beyond MVP. Kept for future scope clarity.
```
System Proactive Analysis: "I notice you have 6 back-to-back meetings tomorrow with no prep time"

**Master Agent Proactive Analysis:**
├── Pattern Recognition: Calendar health deterioration detected
├── Context Analysis: Meeting importance vs. rescheduling flexibility
├── Optimization Opportunity: Prep time insertion, strategic rescheduling
└── Multi-Agent Coordination: Calendar analysis + Email diplomacy

**Proactive Agent Coordination:**

Master Agent → Calendar Agent:
"Analyze tomorrow's calendar health. 6 back-to-back meetings detected. Assess rescheduling opportunities and prep time insertion options."

Calendar Agent Analysis:
- Meeting importance scoring: 2 critical, 3 important, 1 flexible
- Rescheduling feasibility: 3 meetings have alternative slots
- Prep time gaps: Zero buffer between customer calls
- Optimization recommendation: Reschedule 2 internal meetings, add 15-min buffers

Calendar Agent → Master Agent:
"Calendar optimization identified: Can reschedule marketing sync (low priority) and move 1:1 with Sarah to Thursday. This creates 45 minutes prep time before customer calls."

Master Agent → Email Agent:
"Draft polite rescheduling requests for marketing sync and Sarah's 1:1. Emphasize optimization benefits and offer alternative times."

Email Agent → Master Agent:
"Rescheduling requests drafted with positive framing: 'optimizing for better preparation time.' Alternative slots proposed. Ready for your approval before sending."

Master Agent → User:
"I noticed tomorrow's packed schedule and identified optimization opportunities. Calendar Agent found rescheduling options, Email Agent drafted polite requests. Approve to proceed?"
```
