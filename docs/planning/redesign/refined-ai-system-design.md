## Intelligence-First Flow

### Proactive Intelligence Cycle
1. **Pattern Detection**: Intelligence Agent continuously analyzes user behavior, communication patterns, and scheduling trends
2. **Opportunity Identification**: Identifies optimization opportunities and potential issues
3. **Proactive Suggestions**: Presents intelligent recommendations to user
4. **Learning Integration**: Incorporates user feedback and outcomes to improve future suggestions

### Cross-Domain Integration
**Email-Calendar Intelligence**:
- Meeting outcomes influence follow-up email sequences
- Email relationship strength affects meeting scheduling priority
- Communication patterns optimize meeting timing and duration
- Calendar gaps trigger proactive email outreach suggestions

**Workflow Learning**:
- Identifies recurring multi-step patterns across domains
- Learns optimal timing for different types of communications
- Recognizes relationship-specific workflow preferences
- Automates routine sequences while maintaining user control

## Conversational Coordination Framework

### Agent Communication Protocols
**Intelligence-Driven Delegation**:
- Intelligence Agent analyzes request and recommends approach
- Master Orchestrator delegates to appropriate execution agents
- Execution agents report back with results and insights
- Intelligence Agent captures patterns for future optimization

**Example Flow**:
```
User: "Set up the board meeting next month"

Master Orchestrator → Intelligence Agent:
"Analyze board meeting requirements and recommend approach"

Intelligence Agent Response:
"Board meeting detected. High-stakes, formal. Stakeholders: 8 executives.
Optimal timing: March 15, avoid March 8 (conflicting investor call).
Recommend: formal venue, AV setup, 2-hour duration, prep time blocking.
Coordination sequence: Calendar → Email → Follow-up automation"

Master Orchestrator → Coordination Agent:
"Schedule board meeting March 15, formal venue with AV"

Coordination Agent → Master Orchestrator:
"Board meeting scheduled March 15, 2-4pm EST, Conference Room A booked"

Master Orchestrator → Communication Agent:
"Send formal board invitations with agenda deadline"

Communication Agent → Master Orchestrator:
"Formal invitations sent to 8 members, RSVP tracking active"

Master Orchestrator → Automation Agent:
"Set up follow-up sequence for agenda collection and RSVP tracking"

Automation Agent → Master Orchestrator:
"Automation sequence configured: agenda deadline March 8, RSVP follow-ups scheduled"
```
