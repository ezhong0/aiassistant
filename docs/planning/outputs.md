## Technical Requirements

### Slack Integration
- Slash commands for setup and configuration
- @mentions in channels and DMs for natural language commands
- Rich message formatting with structured previews
- Confirmation flows using reply messages
- Error handling with helpful user messages

### Gmail Integration
- OAuth 2.0 authentication with Gmail API
- Read inbox and sent items
- Send emails with proper formatting
- Contact resolution from previous emails
- Handle API rate limits gracefully

### Google Calendar Integration
- OAuth 2.0 authentication with Calendar API
- Read calendar events across timeframes
- Create, modify, and delete events
- Send calendar invitations to attendees
- Handle timezone considerations

### Natural Language Processing
- Intent recognition for all command types
- Entity extraction (contacts, times, dates, subjects)
- Context awareness for follow-up commands
- Ambiguity resolution with clarifying questions
- Smart defaults for missing information

## Implementation Notes

### Time Handling
- Uses current date/time (05:39 PM PDT, September 07, 2025) as reference for "today" or "tomorrow"
- Intelligent parsing of relative times ("at 7" ‚Üí 7:00 PM today)
- Timezone awareness based on user settings

### Contact Resolution
- If a name (e.g., "john") isn't resolved, respond: "Couldn't find 'john'. Please provide an email or clarify."
- Learn from previous interactions to build contact database
- Fuzzy matching for common name variations

### Confirmation Flow
- All write operations require explicit confirmation
- After "yes" confirmation, follow with: `‚úÖ **Action Completed Successfully** Operation completed.`
- "No" cancellation returns to normal conversation

### Response Limits
- Cap pending emails/tasks at 5-10 per response
- Calendar shows all relevant events for requested timeframe
- Use "show more" pattern for additional items

### Edge Cases
- Handle vague times with intelligent defaults
- Auto-generate polite content for brief requests
- Graceful degradation when APIs are unavailable
- Clear error messages without technical details

## Success Metrics

### Primary KPIs
- **Daily Active Users**: Users who send at least 1 command per day
- **Commands per User**: Average commands executed per active user
- **Action Completion Rate**: % of previewed actions that get confirmed
- **User Retention**: % of users active after 7, 30, and 90 days

### Secondary KPIs
- **Setup Completion Rate**: % of users who complete OAuth for both email and calendar
- **Error Rate**: % of commands that fail to execute properly
- **Response Time**: Average time from command to preview/completion
- **Feature Usage**: Distribution of command types used
