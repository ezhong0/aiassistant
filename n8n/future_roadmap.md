# Voice-Controlled Workplace Automation - Future Roadmap

## Long-Term Vision: Productivity AI "Switzerland"
Become the comprehensive voice-controlled workplace automation platform - the neutral layer that works across all productivity tools with intelligent context awareness.

## Expansion Architecture
```
React Native Mobile App (Dark Mode)
      ↓ HTTPS/WebSocket  
n8n Cloud Workflow Engine
      ↓ OAuth API Calls
Gmail API + Google Calendar API + OpenAI API
    ↓ Future Expansion
Microsoft 365 + Slack + Salesforce + Notion + More
```

## Future Expansion Roadmap

### Phase 2: Microsoft 365 Integration
- Outlook email + calendar
- Teams integration  
- Cross-platform context ("Email John and create Teams meeting")

### Phase 3: Workplace Collaboration
- Slack/Teams message management
- Meeting transcription and follow-ups
- Document collaboration (Google Docs, Office 365)

### Phase 4: CRM & Sales Automation
- Salesforce, HubSpot integration
- Lead management via voice
- Pipeline updates and follow-ups

### Phase 5: Project Management
- Notion, Asana, Monday.com integration
- Task creation and updates
- Cross-tool workflow automation

## Advanced Context Handling (Post-MVP)

### Level 2: Enhanced Context
```javascript
// 30-minute rolling context window
const contextWindow = {
  emails: {
    recent: [/* last 10 emails viewed/sent */],
    currentThread: { /* active conversation */ },
    drafts: [/* unsent previews */]
  },
  calendar: {
    recentEvents: [/* last created/modified */],
    conflicts: [/* detected scheduling conflicts */],
    pendingInvites: [/* awaiting response */]
  },
  voice: {
    lastCommand: "reply to john",
    clarifications: [/* if user said 'actually, change that' */],
    confidence: 0.89
  },
  expires: Date.now() + (30 * 60 * 1000) // 30min TTL
}
```

### Level 3: Contextual Intelligence
- Parse pronouns ("reply to that", "schedule it")
- Track conversation state ("actually, make it 3pm")
- Learn user patterns ("Friday meetings are usually 30min")
- Proactive suggestions ("You usually reply to Sarah quickly")
- Cross-session learning (while maintaining privacy)

## Market Positioning Strategy

### Target Evolution
- **Phase 1:** Individual productivity (Gmail/Calendar)
- **Phase 2:** Knowledge workers (Microsoft 365)
- **Phase 3:** Team collaboration (Slack/Teams)
- **Phase 4:** Sales professionals (CRM integration)
- **Phase 5:** Enterprise automation (full platform)

### Competitive Advantage
- **Platform neutral:** Works across all productivity tools
- **Voice-first design:** Unlike desktop-focused competitors
- **Privacy-by-design:** 30-minute context windows, no data collection
- **Natural conversation:** Advanced context understanding
- **Mobile-native:** Built for modern workforce mobility

This roadmap will be executed only after successful MVP validation and user adoption.
