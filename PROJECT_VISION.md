## 📱 Product Design Vision

### **UI/UX Framework: "Conversation + Action Cards"**

#### **Primary Interface: Voice-First Design**
```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│     Conversation History    │
│  ┌─────────────────────┐   │
│  │ "Send email to John │   │  
│  │  about quarterly    │   │
│  │  review"           │    │
│  └─────────────────────┘   │
│                             │
│     [Action Card Preview]   │
│  ┌─────────────────────┐   │
│  │ 📧 Email Draft      │   │
│  │ To: John Smith      │   │
│  │ Subject: Quarterly  │   │  
│  │ Review Discussion   │   │
│  │ [Send] [Edit] [❌] │   │
│  └─────────────────────┘   │
│                             │
│      🎤 [Large Mic]         │
│     "Tap to speak"          │
│                             │
│ Status: "Ready to listen"   │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

#### **Design Principles**
